<p>The <b>Supermatter Crystal</b> is the primary power source in most stations. A <b>supermatter shard</b> can be ordered from <a href="/wiki/Cargo" class="mw-redirect" title="Cargo">Cargo</a>, which works the same way, but can be moved around. Its primary features are emitting electrical arcs that are harnessed to power the station through tesla coils. Side effects include radiation emission, making everyone who could theoretically see it hallucinate, releasing hot oxygen and plasma, heating the air around, and exploding or creating singularity/tesla or eating the entire station if you screw up hard enough. It begins inert but being hit by an object or projectile will activate it and it'll start exhibiting nearly all of the aforementioned properties.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Words_of_Warning">Words of Warning</span></h2>
<ol><li>The Supermatter is VERY DANGEROUS. Activating the Supermatter should be the last step in setting up any form of Supermatter based power! If you ordered it from cargo the crate should stay LOCKED AND SECURED until everything is ready.</li>
<li>You require safety gear. A full radiation suit AND meson scanners.</li>
<li>Most of "setting up the Supermatter" involves a gas loop that is designed to cool down the Supermatter chamber. While not required, please have some knowledge of gasses, or atmospheric properties.</li>
<li>Anything that bumps into the Supermatter is fundamentally annihilated. Don't touch it. This means weld, and ask the AI to bolt the door to the Supermatter .</li>
<li>Of all clothing normally available on the station, only radiation suits and the <a href="/wiki/Chief_Engineer" title="Chief Engineer">CE's</a> hardsuit have complete radiation protection. The engineering hardsuit has 75% radiation protection. <a href="/wiki/Atmospheric_Technician" title="Atmospheric Technician">Atmos</a> hardsuit has 25%. <a href="/wiki/Research_Director" title="Research Director">RD's</a> and <a href="/wiki/Chief_Medical_Officer" title="Chief Medical Officer">CMO's</a> have 60%. Even a small amount of radiation might end up being debilitating, so if you're working near an active Supermatter Engine, make sure you're dressed for the job.</li></ol>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Mechanics">Mechanics</span></h2>
<p>The supermatter is an extremely unstable crystal with particular properties. Here's an executive summary on how it behaves:
</p>
<ol><li>A portion of the gas mixture on the supermatter's tile is absorbed by it. Most gases have unique effects on the supermatter which can be seen <a href="#Gas_Interactions">here</a>. Most notably gases will change the heat output, allow internal energy to be generated from heat, change the power decay and influence the zap power.</li>
<li>The supermatter's internal energy (the entry with MeV/cm3 as it's unit) is calculated. This internal energy determines the power generated by zaps, amount and temperature of waste gas, range of radiation and hallucinations, and a slew of other factors.<br /> Internal energy is subject to decay over time, so if the supermatter is left without an energy source for too long it will output less and less power. To combat this decay most supermatter engines will have an external source of energy, most often emitters <a href="/wiki/File:Emitter_On.gif" class="image"><img alt="Emitter On.gif" src="/wiki/images/1/18/Emitter_On.gif" decoding="async" width="32" height="32" data-file-width="32" data-file-height="32" /></a>. Though there are a few other factors that can influence this internal energy such as special gas mixtures, energy weapons <a href="/wiki/File:Energy_Gun.gif" class="image"><img alt="Energy Gun.gif" src="/wiki/images/e/e7/Energy_Gun.gif" decoding="async" width="32" height="32" data-file-width="32" data-file-height="32" /></a>, items hitting the supermatter, or even kisses.</li>
<li>The supermatter will start taking damage if the absorbed gas is too hot, if the internal energy is too high, if there are too many moles, or if it's exposed to space while on (internal energy above zero).<br />When the integrity reaches 0% the supermatter will initiate a 30 second final countdown and delaminate if not healed within that timespan. There are a few different delaminations that can occur.</li>
<li>The supermatter will spew out the initially absorbed gas mixture alongside extra waste gas that it produced. This waste gas is hot and is the most common cause of crystal delaminations. Without proper cooling a powered supermatter will delaminate.</li></ol>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Integrity">Integrity</span></h3>
<p>Under suboptimal conditions, the supermatter will start taking damage and lose integrity. As the supermatter crystal takes damage it will be harder and harder to save. 
</p>
<table class="wikitable">
<caption>Damage Factors
</caption>

<p>The aforementioned Heating Damage is taken when the supermatter absorbed gas mixture is above a certain temperature limit. This temperature limit is usually at 626.3 Kelvins but can be changed by a slew of other factors.

<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Delaminations">Delaminations</span></h4>
<p>Once the supermatter reaches 0% integrity it will initiate a 30 second countdown and delaminate. During this 30 second window there are two important things to consider:
</p>
<ol><li>The supermatter can still recover from the delamination.</li>
<li>The supermatter can still take damage. I.E. the integrity can go to the negatives but is not displayed in the UI.</li></ol>
<p>To recover the crystal from the impending delamination, the supermatter needs to heal back up to a positive integrity, including the damage taken during the 30 second timespan.
</p><p>If the supermatter is not saved within this timespan, the supermatter will delaminate into one of four possible conditions, with conditions mentioned later in the list taking priority. (I.E. if a supermatter can delaminate into a tesla or singularity, it will prefer the singularity):
</p>
<ol><li><b>Explosive / Default Delamination</b> <br /> The supermatter will simply explode depending on the gas heat power generation of the absorbed gasmix. Alongside this the supermatter will also irradiate any nearby living beings, cause stationwide hallucinations and mood debuff, and spawn anomalies. Triggered without any causes.</li>
<li><b>Tesla Delamination</b> <br /> The supermatter will explode, spawn an energy ball, irradiate, hallucinate, and spawn anomalies. Triggered by a delamination with the supermatter internal energy above 5000 MeV.</li>
<li><b>Singularity Delamination</b> <br /> The supermatter will spawn a singularity, irradiate, hallucinate, and spawn anomalies. Triggered by a delamination with the supermatter absorbing more than 1800 moles.</li>
<li><b>Resonance Cascade Delamination</b> <br /> The supermatter will initially explode and hallucinate. It will then spawn crystal mass all over the station that can dust things that hits it. The emergency shuttle will no longer able to be called, and CentCom will open an exit portal as the last means for evacuation. Once the crystal mass hits this escape rift, the round will end. Triggered by a delamination with the supermatter having more than 40% Anti-Noblium and 40% Hyper-Noblium with absorbed moles being above 270 or by a Destabilizing Crystal traitor item.</li></ol>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Internal_Energy">Internal Energy</span></h3>
<p>The crystal's power determines how much energy is produced each tick through arcs, and also the range and amount of radiation and hallucinations generated. (a 'tick' usually takes around 1-5 seconds depending on lag). Internal energy will also be a major factor in the heat output of the supermatter, so efforts to lower it while saving a delaminating supermatter should be undertaken.

<p>The crystal produces plasma and oxygen while it's active. Plasma and temperature is produced according to the energy, while the main factor for oxygen will be the temperature of the absorbed gasmix (energy also plays a small role). These are then multiplied by the waste factors detailed below.
</p><p>While the supermatter starts taking damage at 626 Kelvin by default, plasma and oxygen combusts at 373.15 Kelvin. This combustion is exothermic and will very often bring the temperature of the supermatter well above the 626 Kelvin threshold. For most cases this combustion temperature will be the number you want to avoid instead of the damage threshold.

This O2 will also react with the Plasma to create Tritium and then, to the further horror of many an Engineer, a Tritium fire.
<p>However, as long as the SM isn't over the tipping point, adding N2O will slow a delamination.

This means that Plasma can be kept happy with enough cooling, whereas Tritium eagerly goes from a safe space loop into a burning hellfire. Add to this the byproduct of large amounts of Oxygen production (not exclusive to Tritium. An issue in a Plasma engine too), and you have a tritium fire and a very hot crystal. Do not use this gas unless you have a very strong understanding of atmospherics and the Supermatter, and are willing to get creative.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Step_two:_Prepare_the_gas_loop">Step two: Prepare the gas loop</span></h3>
<ol><li>Color code: Green. Turn the bypass pump off
<dl><dd><b>Why:</b> This pump is used to bypass the chamber and to precool the gas before entering it. This pump however is a detriment to us on started Supermatter crystals, since it reduces the amount of cooled gas inserted into the chamber.</dd></dl></li>
<li>Color code: Red. Your first step should be wrenching the N2 canisters in place. Afterwards, turn the pump on and maximize it. (Hotkeys: ctrl-click to turn on, alt-click to maximize)
<dl><dd><b>Why:</b> When the crystal is generating power it produces plasma and oxygen and heats up the air surrounding it immensely, thus it needs to be properly ventilated. We start by making the gas loop push N2 around the loop, cooling it with the coldness of space before re-entering the engine room again.</dd></dl></li>
<li>Color code: Orange. Maximize the pumps leading to and out of the Supermatter chamber
<dl><dd><b>Why:</b> A larger quantity of cooled gas inside the Supermatter will snuff out waste gas and heat better than one that isn't properly filled. This also makes the gas movement for the whole engine much quicker. (Be mindful of molar delaminations, though this is unlikely.)</dd></dl></li>
<li>Color code: Blue. Turn the filter on, maximize it, and set it to filter nothing.
<dl><dd><b>Why:</b> This filter is commonly used to collect useful gases from the Supermatter engine to be used elsewhere. We do not need this filter to be set to anything for stable power generation, though they are not mutually exclusive.</dd></dl></li>
<li>Color code: Violet. Maximize the pumps leading to the space exchangers.
<dl><dd><b>Why:</b> This makes the gas movement for the whole engine much quicker, allowing gas to be cooled and pumped in faster.</dd></dl></li>
<li>Color code: White. Turn on all the filters and maximize them. Set the filter with the double circle to Nitrogen (they are set to Nitrogen by default, might be worth it to double check them.) All other filters can be set to nothing.
<dl><dd><b>Why:</b> This filter complex dictates which gas will be let inside the Supermatter chamber. We are currently running a simple Nitrogen engine, so we need only the first filter to be set to nitrogen. The other three filters still need to be on and set to nothing in order for the bad gas to actually get vented, keep this in mind! If the first filter had been tampered with and the chamber is running out of nitrogen, repeat step one with Nitrogen canisters obtained from other parts of the station.</dd></dl></li>
<li>Color code: Brown (where applicable). Turn on and maximize these freezer (or freezer bypass) pumps.
<dl><dd><b>Why:</b> For meta and box derived Supermatter engines, the brown pumps are the last piece of pump separating the cooled gas from the chamber. In some maps (e.g. Ice Box) it is preferable to incorporate the freezers from roundstart due to freezers (73 Kelvins) being colder than space (180+20 Kelvins). For several maps where the space loop is colder (2.7+20 Kelvins), the bypass might be preferred until upgrades are available.</dd></dl></li>
<li>Color code: Pink (where applicable). Turn on and minimize the temperature on these freezers.
<dl><dd><b>Why:</b> For reasons stated above, this will mostly be used on supermatter engines with suboptimal space loops.</dd></dl></li>
<li>Color code: Grey-blue (Where applicable). Turn the space valve on.
<dl><dd><b>Why:</b> This valve separates the filtered waste gas from the space injector. Turn this on to prevent clogging. Only applicable in delta station.</dd></dl></li>

<dl><dd><b>Why:</b> Internal and External acts as limits for the vents. Limits can only slow down vents, and we want vents to be as fast as possible. So we disable the limits to allow gas to flow into the supermatter in any condition.</dd></dl></li>

<dl><dd><b>Why:</b> Siphon makes the scrubbers remove all gases. This is to ensure hot gasses are removed from the chamber as fast as possible, to prevent too high pressure in the chamber.</dd></dl></li>
<li>Color code: N/A. Review the crystal's status using the NT-CIMS <a href="/wiki/File:Tablet.gif" class="image"><img alt="Tablet.gif" src="/wiki/images/8/88/Tablet.gif" decoding="async" width="32" height="32" data-file-width="32" data-file-height="32" /></a> program.
<dl><dd><b>Why:</b> The NT CIMS provides great insight on troubleshooting supermatter related problems. If you did everything correctly, the temperature should be dropping, the gas composition will shift heavily towards pure nitrogen, and there should be enough moles inside the chamber (above 8).</dd></dl></li></ol>
<p>With these all done, the nitrogen should be cycling through the system and getting nice and cool. Give yourself a pat on the back, for the hardest part is over!

<ol><li><b>Double-check to ensure the cooling loop is active, you don't want to have an active supermatter with a pump still set to 101kPa or the vents/scrubbers inactive!</b></li>
<li>For supermatter engines on Delta Station, you need to set everything yourself. Haul emitters and reflectors around to your desired setup, wrench and weld the emitters once aligned properly (rotate with Alt-Click), and weld the reflectors.

<li>Align the reflectors so that the emitter beams are deflected towards the supermatter crystal.</li>

<p>The supermatter will now begin arcing and generating power.
</p><p>If the emitters are not firing despite being turned on, it means they are not being sufficiently powered. This could either be because a cable to them have been severed (less likely), or the station does not have enough power to run them. To fix this, you could:
</p>
<ol><li>Check the cable and ensure a proper connection is made between the power reservoir (SMES) and the emitters.</li>
<li>Maximizing the SMES might solve some fringe cases of the station having enough power stored but not enough power flowing.</li>

</p><p><b>You want to replace most pumps you can find with either straight pipes or with valves. </b> It is recommended to do this in the start of the round, so that we don't lose any gases from unwrenching atmospheric devices. 
</p><p>This is because gas in a network is always evenly spread through all connected pipe. Pumps exist only to create pressure gradients, but in the supermatter where gas is always flowing in a circular fashion it will only restrict flow, or even worse clog on delaminations.
</p><p>Pictured to the right is the roundstart MetaStation SM setup, but modified to have all the unneeded pumps / filters removed. Pumps have a set limit on the amount of gas that can flow through each tick, and when dealing with a SM Delamination, every second counts.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Cooling">Cooling</span></h3>
<p>The direct turf (location/tile) of the supermatter is what dictates it's behaviour, and thus an integral part of any supermatter engine is sufficient cooling of the crystal's immediate environment.  The cooling system used by the standard supermatter engine is a dynamic system; meaning that the gases around the supermatter flow to other parts of the engine in order to get cooled. This is why a single pipe being broken might cause catastrophic consequences.
</p><p>On our standard supermatter setup, there are two main factors of cooling: heat exchanger pipes and freezers. Note that both of these apparatus perform cooling only on the gas <a href="/wiki/Guide_to_Atmospherics#Pipeline_and_Pipenet_Theory" title="Guide to Atmospherics">in it's immediate "container"</a>. A single freezer or heat exchanger pipe will be less effective on a larger pipe network than a smaller one due to it getting a smaller share of the gas that it is able to cool. Keep this in mind when doing expansion to the setup.
</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Heat_exchangers"><a href="/wiki/File:He_pipe.png" class="image"><img alt="He pipe.png" src="/wiki/images/c/cd/He_pipe.png" decoding="async" width="32" height="32" data-file-width="32" data-file-height="32" /></a>Heat exchangers</span></h4>
<p>Heat exchangers work on the basis of conduction, that is between the heat exchanger and the turf it is in. For our supermatter heat exchangers, the heat sharing will be performed with a space turf (with the temperature of 2.7 Kelvins and heat capacity of 7000 J/K.) or snow turf (with the temperature of 180 Kelvins and heat capacity that varies slightly). This conduction process will only happen when the temperature difference between the two gas mixtures is higher than 20 Kelvin or Celcius.<br />Expanding the cooling loop means expanding the part of the pipe network that is actually able to exchange heat, therefore increasing the cooling power. However doing also means that the filters will be able to work on a smaller amount of gas, lowering the amount of gas that goes into the supermatter chamber. It might be worthwile to pump in more coolant if efforts to expand the loop are undertaken.
</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Freezers"><a href="/wiki/File:Freezer.gif" class="image"><img alt="Freezer.gif" src="/wiki/images/7/73/Freezer.gif" decoding="async" width="32" height="32" data-file-width="32" data-file-height="32" /></a> Freezers</span></h4>
<p>Freezers also work on the principle of heat exchanging. The gas directly present in it will have it's heat exchanged with a gas mixture with heat capacity and temperature dictated by the parts and setting. For more information on thermomachines head <a href="/wiki/Guide_to_Atmospherics#Thermomachines" title="Guide to Atmospherics">here</a>.

<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="In-Chamber_Cooling">In-Chamber Cooling</span></h4>
<p>It is possible to use heat exchanger pipes filled with cooled <a href="/wiki/File:Plasma_Canister.png" class="image"><img alt="Plasma Canister.png" src="/wiki/images/2/29/Plasma_Canister.png" decoding="async" width="32" height="32" data-file-width="32" data-file-height="32" /></a> Plasma directly inside the crystal's chamber for even better cooling. This method of cooling however is not present by default and will need to be added in by an engineer.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Mitigating_Delaminations">Mitigating Delaminations</span></h3>
<p>The first step to averting delaminations is to <b>turn the emitters off</b>. Waste produced by the supermatter scales based on energy, so cutting the energy supply to the crystal is one of the best first steps to take.
</p><p>There is no one sure way to fix the supermatter, but there are a few common causes:
</p>
<ul><li>Gas pumps are offline or left on default pressure.</li>
<li>Gas filters offline, left on default pressure.</li>
<li>No gas filter set to filter coolant back into the loop. If nitrogen has fully ran out from the supermatter set up just set filters and add more coolant either through canisters or through the Atmos to Engine pipe in Atmospherics.</li>
<li>Supermatter chamber vents improperly configured.</li>
<li>Supermatter chamber scrubbers not siphoning.</li>
<li>Heat exchange pipes broken. Space dust can slip through the defenses on occasion. Or a traitor may detach a section.</li>
<li>Too much gas, especially on supermatter with pumps. If a section has too high of a pressure, the gas pumps cannot push anything more into it!</li>
<li>Too little gas, especially on supermatter setups with an expanded cooling loop. Lack of nitrogen coolant will make the oxygen and plasma dumped by the supermatter take up a larger portion of the composition, raising the waste multiplier significantly.</li></ul>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Sabotaging_the_Supermatter">Sabotaging the Supermatter</span></h2>
<p>Want to sabotage the crystal but can't figure out how to pull it off? Here are some pointers and hints:
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="General_hints">General hints</span></h3>
<ul><li><b>You can break the APC of the room to stop all pipes and scrubbers from working.</b></li>
<li><b>When the crystal reaches 0% integrity a 30 second countdown until the explosion will be broadcast on common channel, even if telecomms is desintegrated.</b></li>
<li>Disable the telecomms APC with the CE console to prevent the supermatter from announcing its status.</li>
<li>Cut cameras near the engine.</li>
<li>Instead of turning off pumps and filters, you can just set them to extremely low values instead. They'll still appear to be working.</li>
<li>Taking out all the engineers before attempting a delamination helps a lot.</li>
<li>Opening a canister of plasma in engineering and igniting it will make it a lot harder for people to fix your sabotage. Even more effective if the radiation levels are high.</li>
<li>Keep a flash or EMP on hand. The AI and its borgs are pretty much guaranteed to try and intervene to prevent harm.</li>
<li>Stay around and pretend to be helping so you can undo all the repair attempts by other people.</li>
<li>Or ignore everything above and just empty a magazine into the crystal making it near instantly start the 30 second delamination countdown, before anyone can stop you, or even notice, this applies even if you want to do the more spicy delaminations listed below, since the crystal doesn't have to delaminate from high power or high pressure, it just has to be in the state needed when exploding and can delaminate from bullets.</li></ul>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Regular_delamination">Regular delamination</span></h3>
<p>These are the easiest to pull off and require no special conditions. You'll want to keep the supermatter chamber very hot and full of plasma or CO2.
</p>
<ul><li>Use the filters near the emitter room to filter out N2 and N2O while keeping Plasma, Oxygen and CO2 in the loop.</li>
<li>Pump in pure plasma or burn mix from atmos.</li>
<li>Disable or break the cooling array. Deconstructing a single piece of the heat exchanger can be enough.</li>
<li>Shooting guns at the crystal is extremely effective, <s>but it's likely that you'll end up in the blast</s> you won't, you'll have 30 seconds to run after the crystal reaches 0% integrity.</li>
<li>Disable the scrubbers once the chamber is hot enough.</li></ul>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Overcharged_delamination">Overcharged delamination</span></h3>
<p>This kind of delamination requires careful gas management but is faster, far more destructive and there's a good chance it will irradiate, burn and shock the engineers who are trying to fix it.
</p>
<ul><li>Ensure that only CO2 is in the supermatter chamber at all times. Filter all other gases and keep the scrubbers running.</li>
<li>Keep the emitters online and firing if you can.</li>
<li>Get as much CO2 into the chamber as possible. Larger amounts of CO2 can even compensate for the oxygen and plasma waste.</li>
<li>Wear as much radiation protection as you can. Consider bringing some anti-toxin medication as well.</li>
<li>Try to keep radiation suits away from engineers, they won't be able to get near the overcharged engine long enough to fix it without one. They will however be able to go near it long enough to beat you to death.</li>
<li>Make sure you are wearing insulated gloves to protect yourself from the lightning arcs.</li>
<li>Disabling the cooling is not required. In fact, keeping the chamber cool might help you get more power.</li>
<li>The anomalies, gravity pulses and lightning arcs will quickly turn the engine room into a deathtrap. Make sure you have everything set up correctly before this starts happening.</li></ul>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Critical_mass_delamination">Critical mass delamination</span></h3>
<p>This is difficult but also simple.
</p>
<ul><li>Pump in as much gas as possible into the chamber. The easiest way to do this is to disable the pressure checks on the vent air alarms.</li>
<li>Reverse the scrubber pump. It's a subtle alteration that might get overlooked in the heat of the moment and will prevent the excess gas from being pumped out.</li>
<li>Make sure no gas leaves the chamber. Put up walls, deconstruct scrubber pipes, do whatever possible to keep the gas inside.</li></ul>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Resonance_cascade_delamination">Resonance cascade delamination</span></h3>
<p>This type of delamination requires particular care and effort, as it requires <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://tgstation13.org/wiki/Guide_to_Atmospherics#Anti-Noblium">anti-noblium</a> which is obtained from the <a href="/wiki/Guide_to_the_Hypertorus_Fusion_Reactor" title="Guide to the Hypertorus Fusion Reactor">Hypertorus Fusion Reactor</a> or from the use of an Electrolyzer. Either way, this type of delamination requires the sourcing of specific materials which will require a rounds worth of effort. 
</p>
<ul><li>Ensure the supermatter chamber is filled with a gas mixture that is at least 40% Hyper-Noblium, and 40% Anti-Noblium.</li>
<li>Ensure that the supermatter engine has an integrity that is greater than 80%.</li>
<li>Ensure that there are more than 12000 moles of gas inside the Supermatter chamber.</li></ul>
<p>Alternatively, if you are a dirty <a href="/wiki/Traitor" title="Traitor">traitor</a> and you received the objective to cause a cascade, do the following:
</p>
<ul><li>Ensure the crystal has over 80% integrity.</li>
<li>Attach the destabilizing crystal from your objective to the crystal. Make sure you have protection from the engine's gravitational force.</li>
<li>A destabilizing crystal will not cause the engine to delaminate by itself. Proceed with one of the delaminations steps above.</li></ul>
<p>Note that resonance cascade delaminations <i>only work on the main engine, not on shards.</i> You will not receive the objective if there is no valid engine.
