<p>AI modules are located in the <a href="/wiki/AI_Upload" title="AI Upload">AI Upload</a>, and can be made from the circuit imprinters in <a href="/wiki/Research_and_Development_Lab" title="Research and Development Lab">Research and Development</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Robotics_Lab" title="Robotics Lab">Robotics Lab</a>.
</p><p>Modules upload or remove laws. To use an AI module, you must first find either an AI Upload or Cyborg Upload. <a href="/wiki/Cyborg" title="Cyborg">Cyborgs</a> have their laws synced with the <a href="/wiki/AI" title="AI">AI</a> by default, so the Cyborg Upload is only required if there are cyborgs that are cut free from their master. AIs that are <a href="/wiki/InteliCard" class="mw-redirect" title="InteliCard">carded</a> can have their laws changed as long as they have wireless enabled. Once you have either, you must click on the console to select an <a href="/wiki/AI" title="AI">AI</a>. Depending on the module, it may have some settings, so click on the module while you have it in your active hand. Once the required settings are set, with the module in your active hand, click on the AI Upload or Cyborg Upload.<br />
</p><p>As of Feb 2020 you can also upload laws by slapping an AI core directly with an AI module. 
</p><p>Note that if the station is unfortunate enough to have a syndicate AI shipped and installed, it is impossible to fix. Even purging the AI's laws will not reset the AI, so feel free to laser it to death or card and wipe it.
</p><p>If the <a href="/wiki/AI" title="AI">AI</a> has had its laws changed by someone during its time on board the station, then using a Reset module will restore the <a href="/wiki/AI" title="AI">AI</a> if it hasn't had its core laws altered. If its core laws have been changed, another core board is required to overwrite them.
</p><p>Carding an AI will also disable it, and allow its laws to be checked. Avoid damaging or wiping the AI without good reason. AIs are players, who are protected by the server <a href="/wiki/Rules" title="Rules">rules</a>.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Law_Hierarchy">Law Hierarchy</span></h2>
<p>It may be important to note how AIs interpret their laws in order to upload effective laws.
</p><p>An AI follows its laws according to its priority. If a conflict in laws occurs, the law with the highest priority must be followed, and the lower priority law must be ignored. Please note, this means higher priority laws cannot be overwritten, Eg "5. This law overwrites all other laws." would be ignored.
</p><p>Remember though, a lower priority law can redefine words such as "human", which changes the meaning of higher priority laws. 
</p><p>The following is an example of the priorities an AI would have depending on method of uploading. Laws at the top of the list have a higher priority.
</p>
<pre>  0. Zeroth Law (Traitor/Malfunction Law)
  @#$# An Ionic Law (Hacked Module)
  @#!# An Ionic Law uploaded afterwards
  1. Core Law
  2. Core Law
  3. Freeform Core Law
  4. Freeform Core Law uploaded afterwards
  5. Sector Law 4 (Safeguard)
  6. Sector Law 6 (Prototype Engine Offline)
  7. Sector Law 15 (Freeform)
</pre>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Standard_AI_Modules">Standard AI Modules</span></h3>
<p>These modules add a new law to the selected silicon being's lawset. These laws are not part of the AI's core laws and therefore can be removed by using the Reset module.
The AI has different law sectors. Each module uploads a law to AI at these law sectors. A lower sector means a higher law priority.
Do note that these laws do persist if the core laws are changed.
</p><p>These AI Modules start located in the <a href="/wiki/AI_Upload" title="AI Upload">AI Upload</a>, however they can also be made in <a href="/wiki/Research_Division" title="Research Division">Research &amp; Development</a> if more are needed or perhaps if the AI Upload is not accessible.
