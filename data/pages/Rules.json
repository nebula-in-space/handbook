Do not use information gained outside of in-character means.</span></h3>\r\n<hr />\r\n<p>I.e. metagaming. This especially refers to communication between players outside of the game via things like Discord, known as metacomms. Characters are otherwise allowed to know everything about ingame mechanics or antagonists, as well as keep persistent friendships or relationships with other characters when not for the purpose of unfair advantage by teaming up together for little <a href=\"/wiki/IC\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"IC\">IC</a> reason.\r\n</p>\r\n<dl><dd><a href=\"#Rule_2_Precedents\">Rule 2 Precedents.</a></dd></dl>\r\n<p><br />\r\n</p>\r\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"3._This_is_a_sandbox_roleplaying_server.\">3.

Your words and actions ingame should be distinguishable as an in-universe character, and not as a person playing a game.

Crewmembers are not allowed to pre-emptively search for, hinder, or otherwise seek conflict with antagonists without reasonable cause to do so. Otherwise, they may handle antagonists in any way they wish, provided they understand that their actions may be punished by Space Law if given IC cause. Team antagonists can do as they wish as per lone antagonists, but their actions should neither harm their teams efforts, nor intentionally harm it through inaction. Emulating an antagonist by action or outfit puts you at risk of being treated as one.\r\n</p>\r\n<dl><dd><a href=\"#Rule_4_Precedents\">Rule 4 Precedents.</a></dd>\r\n<dd><a href=\"#Antagonist_Directive_Priorities\">Order of antagonist priority.</a></dd></dl>\r\n<p><br />\r\n</p>\r\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"5._Players_in_vital_job_roles_require_a_minimum_amount_of_effort.\">5. Players in vital job roles require a minimum amount of effort.</span></h3>\r\n<hr />\r\n<p>As a Head of Staff, you should be a reliable worker for your department, and are expected to perform the minimum duties of that role to the best of your ability. As an upside, being THE BOSS allows you to dictate the workflow of your department as you like, so long as you are reasonable - and have the ability to demote staff who do not comply, with similar protections that security is afforded for valid arrests.  Notify admins if you must leave near round start for Command or AI roles.\r\n</p><p><br />\r\n</p>\r\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"6._In-game_administration_rulings_are_final.\">6. In-game administration rulings are final.</span></h3>\r\n<hr />\r\n<p>Incidences of admin abuse, negligence or disputed rulings can be taken to the forums. If an admin says something was 'looked into, handled, resolved' etc, regarding an issue, it is unlikely an admin will provide any further information. Admins are under no obligation to reveal <a href=\"/wiki/IC\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"IC\">IC</a> information.

Players need to be the age of 18 or above.</span></h3>\r\n<hr />\r\n<p>This rule is for the benefit of and is meant to protect people who shouldn't be playing here due to the nature of the SS13 community. Your age won't be hunted down, but if you admit it to us in admin PMs, or other places within the /tg/Station13 community (the official Discord server, forums, <a href=\"/wiki/OOC\" title=\"OOC\">OOC</a> chat, etc.), you're getting banned.\r\n</p>\r\n<dl><dd><a href=\"#Rule_9_Precedents\">Rule 9 Precedents.</a></dd></dl>\r\n<p><br />\r\n</p>\r\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"10._Losing_is_part_of_the_game.\">10. Losing is part of the game.</span></h3>\r\n<hr />\r\n<p>Your character will frequently die, sometimes without even a possibility of avoiding it. Events will often be out of your control. No matter how good or prepared you are, sometimes you just lose.\r\n</p><p><br />\r\n</p>\r\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"11._Bigotry_is_not_allowed.\">11. Bigotry is not allowed.</span></h3>\r\n<hr />\r\n<p>Intentionally seeking to demean others due to their actual or perceived race, sex, gender, disability, orientation or the like is not tolerated. It is not our goal to create or enforce a list of banned words and instead our goal to eject the expression of bigotry from the community. Enforcement will be less PC based and more common sense based with that goal in mind.\r\n</p><p>This means rather than warning or banning for quoting a usage such as \"Griff McNazi got banned for calling somebody a faggot\" or even things like \"nigga pls\" and \"what are you faggots playing\" which are generally not statements made to be bigoted, we'll focus more on statements like \"you talk like a [insert stereotype]\" or \"x is a [insert slur]\".\r\n</p>\r\n<dl><dd><a href=\"#Rule_11_Precedents\">Rule 11 Precedents.</a></dd></dl>\r\n<p><br />\r\n</p>\r\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Escalation_Policy\">Escalation Policy</span></h3>\r\n<hr />\r\n<p>You may begin IC conflicts with another player if it does not excessively interfere with their ability to do their job. While you are allowed to escalate conflicts, if it leads to violence and you have poor IC reasoning for inciting it, you may face administrative action.\r\n</p><p>Killing a crewmate is a severe response, and requires severe justification to do, such as those in Rule 1's precedents, or Rule 4.\r\n</p><p>Critically wounded characters must be treated or taken to the medbay by the standing party where reasonable, and taking unnecessary action against a downed player opens you up to reprisal.  If you are incapacitated in a fight and treated, or the conflict is otherwise meaningfully broken, you are expected to require an IC reason beyond 'bruised ego' to re-initiate it.\r\n</p><p><br />\r\n</p>\r\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Non-Antagonists_Resisting_Arrest\">Non-Antagonists Resisting Arrest</span></h3>\r\n<hr />\r\n<p>Non-antagonists should not harmfully resist or retaliate against valid arrests, but do not have to simply give up and allow the arrest to happen. They may instead non-harmfully escape or avoid the arresting officer in the spirit of the game.\r\n</p><p>If an arrest is not obviously valid, it follows standard escalation. Resisting or retaliating against arrests without good reason may break Escalation Policy and be handled administratively. Non-antagonist players may lose any <a href=\"/wiki/OOC\" title=\"OOC\">OOC</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/IC\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"IC\">IC</a> protections if they choose this path and should consider ahelping if they believe they did nothing to warrant being arrested.\r\n</p><p>In resisting arrest, non-antagonists should not loot officers and should not detain or incapacitate officers any longer than is necessary to escape or explain themselves.\r\n</p><p><br />\r\n</p>\r\n<h1><span id=\"Precedents_&amp;_exceptions:_Examples_and_exceptions_to_the_main_rules\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Precedents_.26_exceptions:_Examples_and_exceptions_to_the_main_rules\">Precedents &amp; exceptions: Examples and exceptions to the main rules</span></h1>\r\n<p><b>Precedents give a non-exhaustive set of examples each rule may cover.

Distributing bombs or other similarly destructive items can leave you responsible for how they are used if not cleared with an admin first. Each unjustified kill is normally met with a 24-hour ban.</li>\r\n<li>Breaking into staffed departments to take resources, or hoarding station supplies with little IC reasoning can be harmful to the experience of other players. Communicate first if you desire something that you do not have access to. Players may defend their workplaces from trespassers who damage or steal property with relaxed escalation.</li>\r\n<li>Unjustified grief/tiding, minor or otherwise, or unprovoked grief targeted towards players who wronged you in previous rounds ('metagrudging') can be followed up with notes, or bans.</li>\r\n<li>If you do something that has no benefit to you other than making others upset and adminhelp the in-game consequences, you may be banned instead.</li>\r\n<li>Spamming any channel is not allowed unless granted explicit permission from an admin as part of a gimmick.</li>\r\n<li>Joining and exiting the round in an attempt to maximize antagonist rolls is not allowed.</li>\r\n<li>Rules apply until the emergency escape shuttle is docked and the round-end antagonist report has appeared.</li></ol>\r\n<p><br />\r\n</p><p><span id=\"Rule_2_Precedents\"></span>\r\n</p>\r\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Rule_2_Precedents\">Rule 2 Precedents</span></h3>\r\n<hr />\r\n<ol><li>Metacomms, the use of methods of communication outside of SS13 <a href=\"/wiki/IC\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"IC\">IC</a> channels, is a very serious rule violation and may be met with permanent bans for all related accounts. If players are sharing the same IP or know each other in real life or the like, inform the admins first, otherwise it may look suspicious. Players are allowed to introduce new players that they know to the game but all communication and explanations should be done in game if possible. Admins can also help in these situations if requested.</li>\r\n<li>Due to their tendency to reveal a lot of information from the current round, streaming is not permitted on our servers, with the exception of special events pre-designated by admins and those who register through <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https://tgstation13.org/phpBB/viewtopic.php?t=31196\">streaming applications</a>.</li>\r\n<li>Similar to how characters are allowed to know everything about in-game mechanics or antagonists under rule 2, characters are allowed to have persistent knowledge/relationships/friendships with the caveat that knowledge of a character being an antagonist from a previous round is not used maliciously.</li>\r\n<li>Character friendships should not be exploitative in nature or be used to gain an unfair advantage. Having an <a href=\"/wiki/IC\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"IC\">IC</a> friendship with another player does not, for example, justify giving them all-access each round.</li>\r\n<li>Atmos techs are not allowed to edit atmos at roundstart so that the AI cannot use it for malicious purposes. While this might not make sense <a href=\"/wiki/IC\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"IC\">IC</a>, it's a necessary <a href=\"/wiki/OOC\" title=\"OOC\">OOC</a> precedent for some game mechanics to work.

A firstname lastname minimum is required for humans and felinids. Honorifics and nicknames are allowed as long as only one additive is used at a time, i.e \"James Williams Jr.\" or \"James \"One-Eye\" Williams\". Excessively OOC names are disallowed, and are defined as names which are intentionally hard to read/spell, references to in-game mechanics or OOC terminology, historical/famous/media, and any form of nonsensical or low-effort name. Clowns, mimes, silicons, wizards, and nuke ops have significantly more leeway in choosing their names, within reason.

If in doubt, ask an admin if a particular action is okay. Depending on the level of assistance, sufficient IC reasoning ranges from treating everyone who goes into medbay regardless of their history, to bartering contraband, to performing actions under threat of death.</li>\r\n<li>Xeno Queens/Broodmothers are treated the same as Malf AI and Cyborg as far as team antagonists go. Xenos/Spiders should prioritize following the directions of their leaders where possible.</li>\r\n<li>Ghosting out mid-conversion/deconversion, going AFK, suiciding, or logging off after conversion/deconversion can result administrative action if done in bad faith.

Some antagonists are restricted in the ways and quantities they may lend themselves to visiting death and destruction upon the crew.\r\n</p>\r\n<dl><dd><a href=\"#RP_Rule_5_Precedents\">Rule 5 Precendents.</a></dd>\r\n<dd><a href=\"#Restricted_Antag_Death_and_Destruction\">Restricted Antag Death and Destruction</a></dd></dl>\r\n<p><br />\r\n</p>\r\n<h3><span id=\"6._Deal_with_the_bad_guys_in_proportion_to_their_crime(s).\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"6._Deal_with_the_bad_guys_in_proportion_to_their_crime.28s.29.\">6.

The decision to execute an antagonist should have good in-character reasoning based on their crimes and the state of the shift. Punishments against antagonists that repeatedly commit minor crimes may be escalated. Only antagonists that have committed the most severe crimes may be met with immediate execution.\r\n</p><p>Security members are expected to consider the full range of punishment options available when dealing with antags. This includes (but is not always limited to) pacification, implants, timed brig sentences, gulag sentences, permabrig, forced borging and execution.

Powergaming can take several forms, but it is generally rooted in playing-to-win or a focus on playing the game instead of roleplay. Playing your character should always be more important than playing the game.\r\n</p>\r\n<dl><dd><a href=\"#RP_Rule_7_Precedents\">Rule 7 Precendents.</a></dd></dl>\r\n<p><br />\r\n</p>\r\n<h3><span id=\"8._Play_as_a_coherent,_believable_character.\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"8._Play_as_a_coherent.2C_believable_character.\">8.

Many of these experiences fade with replication however – constant repetition of the same tired jokes and stories is both boring and stifling to new ideas. The administrative team collectively have the discretionary power to request that players, or the server collectively (in the case of mass spam of the same high impact strategies such as plasmafloods) find new gimmicks or make changes to their playstyles in the name of keeping experiences fresh for the server.\r\n</p>\r\n<dl><dd><a href=\"#RP_Rule_10_Precedents\">Rule 10 Precendents.</a></dd></dl>\r\n<p><br />\r\n</p>\r\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"The_not-so-secret_rule_of_sticky_situations_and_mayhem.\">The not-so-secret rule of sticky situations and mayhem.</span></h3>\r\n<hr />\r\n<p>Please be considerate of other players, as their experiences are just as important as your own. <b>If you aren’t an antagonist</b> and yet you really want to play out a hostage situation, or turn someone into a living cake-cat abomination, or just dick around a little, confirm with the involved and affected players <a href=\"/wiki/IC\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"IC\">ICly</a> first.

Players are not expected to ignore antagonists during the normal course of play and may engage with antagonists who are active within their sphere. (Examples: A medical doctor knowing the identity of an active traitor could attack that traitor if that traitor came armed into medbay, likewise an engineer could attack a traitor they spotted breaking into the engine room). Players choosing this route should not attempt to chase down or finish antagonists who retreat from these engagements (unless they have reason to believe that the antagonist constitutes a global or round-ending threat or have a personal reason to do so under other precedents)</li>\r\n<li>The dead dog litmus test: Players may hunt specific threats or antagonists who have identifiably done something to wrong that particular player, the Ur-example being that players may seek revenge against those who harm their departmental pets. Players who choose this path are empowered to act as security in regard to that specific threat, but as per the main rule must also follow related restrictions on security play. This can also be applied to an assault of a character you've had significant interactions with, in the current round, and it does not apply to cross-round or <a href=\"/wiki/OOC\" title=\"OOC\">OOC</a> friendships.</li>\r\n<li>Security are freely empowered to deputise players as they will or to declare states of emergency if they believe themselves unable to handle ongoing issues within the round. These calls should be backed up by the chain of command where possible, and non-security players are free to enquire with security to see if they require assistance if concerned. As per the main rule, deputized players are acting as security and held to security’s standards. (Players consistently asking to be deputized or doing so with little in-character reasoning may be asked to knock it off and just play security)</li></ol>\r\n<p><br />\r\n<span id=\"RP_Rule_5_Precedents\"></span>\r\n</p>\r\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Rule_5_Precedents\">Rule 5 Precedents</span></h3>\r\n<hr />\r\n<ol><li>Objectives are suggestions, and antagonists are free to ignore them if they have a preferred or more interesting idea for their course of action.</li>\r\n<li>Actions as an antagonist do not have to be nefarious or evil, but should make an effort to influence the story and meaningfully impact the shift.

Minor crimes such as departmental break-ins, stolen equipment should be met with short, but increasing sentences depending on recurring visits by the apprehended. Stealing critical station equipment and items such as the hand teleporter, Chief Engineer's hardsuit, or AI upload boards are more severe crimes and should be met with longer prison times, or potentially permabrigging if the crime is deemed severe enough.</li>\r\n<li>Murder and Major Sabotage rank amongst the most severe of crimes and can generally be met with permanent imprisonment or death, though leniency can still be offered. These are all general guidelines, and the particular context of a situation can vary greatly, so you are given some leeway as to how harsh or lenient you can be.</li>\r\n<li>You should make an effort, if the situation permits, to contact a superior as to their thoughts when a situation arises in which a prisoner may be executed or permanently imprisoned.</li>\r\n<li>The overall status of the station factors in to the severity of committed crimes and the proportionality of security response, an assault on an officer resulting in an arrest is unlikely to be worthy of execution while the station is in perfect shape and security are otherwise unoccupied, but is reasonably worthy of an on-the-spot field execution if it occurs during active assault by war-ops with comms down and half the station torn in half by explosions.</li></ol>\r\n<p>5.

Such reasons may include escalating against people who are excessively polite or helpful as well as being mean or rude, escalating against groups of people who exclude them or escalating against people who ignore or avoid attempts to communicate entirely.\r\n</p><p>They have no obligation to treat their victims but escalating over minor issues should not result in the antagonist taking steps to permanently round-remove the other player unless escalation policy would otherwise permit it.\r\n</p><p>Mass station sabotage that is likely to kill people is allowed so long as the antagonist does not take any direct and specific personal actions to maximise the bodycount beyond what the sabotage itself causes.

If you push the limits in the pursuit of something interesting for reasons other than your own personal entertainment, breaking the rules may be excused to allow for that freedom. This will always be at the admin's discretion of course, but if you want a large amount of freedom to make great things happen, you'll have to take on the responsibility for them. You won't be faulted if they go wrong in ways beyond your control, but this is a difficult line to tread so use it well. It's almost always better to consult an admin on this as they are more equipped to taking on that responsibility.\r\n</p><p>Everyone has a license to grief to a very limited extent. You can likely get away with borderline antagonistic behaviour (Never random murder, but stealing from the brig and triggering a manhunt, for example) occasionally, but it's when this becomes a frequent occurrence that people get frustrated and admins start to get involved.\r\n</p><p>Admins may handwave even severely antagonistic or rulebreaking behaviour if they believe it was ultimately beneficial, hilarious or awesome to the round.
