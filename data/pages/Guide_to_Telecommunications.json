Don't breathe it, don't stand in it without internals. It has its own SMES and APC. If the APC is destroyed, replace it immediately. If the APC has power temporarily cut, look at the PDA server; if its light is red, the APC probably has a remote signaller in it, because killing APC power turns off the PDA messaging server indefinitely.\r\n</p>\r\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"The_tools\">The tools</span></h2>\r\n<p>All machines are accessed and controlled by a multitool. One is in telecomms at the round start. To link machines, you add a machine to the multitool buffer then use the multitool on the machine to link to and hit [Link] at the bottom. Most telecomms machines will also have FILTERS to determine which frequencies are sent through which pieces of machinery. Additionally, each machine has an IDENTIFICATION STRING, which is just its unique name, and a NETWORK, defaulted to tcommsat, which allows it to link to machines on the same network name only. IF YOU CHANGE THE NETWORK NAME IT'LL UNLINK EVERYTHING. CHANGING THE HUB'S NETWORK NAME IS A COMMON METHOD OF GHETTO SABOTAGE. WATCH FOR IT.\r\n</p>\r\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"The_machines\">The machines</span></h2>\r\n<ul><li>Subspace Receiver: Intakes ;Radio signals</li>\r\n<li>Subspace Broadcaster: Sends ;Radio signals</li>\r\n<li>Bus Mainframe: Regulates ;Radio signals</li>\r\n<li>Processor: Decodes ;Radio signals</li>\r\n<li>Servers: Log ;Radio signals</li>\r\n<li>Hub: Takes in ;Radio signals and sends them to appropriate machines.</li>\r\n<li>Relay: Connected to a Hub on another Z-level.

All essential machines, including a monitoring and logging computer, are present.</div></div></div>\r\n<p>A functional telecommunication central compartment (otherwise known as the \"Server Room\") contains several machines, each with its own isolated function. These machines make up a usually independent telecommunication network, with a pre-specified array of frequencies to process. Optionally, monitoring computers may be used to keep track of telecommunication activity and network integrity. It is important to notice that the machines, most dominantly the <i>Processor Units</i>, generate a significant amount of heat. The central compartment is generally kept at a very low temperature to prevent the damage of the hardware infrastructure, so maintenance is usually not done without proper protective equipment.\r\n</p><p>A <i>central</i> communications compartment is not necessary for a functional telecommunications network. In fact, it may be more efficient to separate the network into sub-nets. Nanotrasen Tech Department, however, strongly suggests the centralization of the machinery for easier maintenance and bookkeeping. While a strong central compartment may be easier to maintain, it is also easier to sabotage or blow up. The only thing worse than explosive concussion damage and massive atmospheric de-stabilization is a downed communication grid. A central compartment should be well-fortified and stable, and fortunately for the crew, Nanotrasen cannot pinch for pennies in this department. The station will either receive a robust Communications Satellite or inner-station Server Room.\r\n</p>\r\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"The_Machines_2\">The Machines</span></h2>\r\n<p>There are 5 different kinds of machines essential for a healthy telecommunication network. Without one or the other, the entire system would cease to function or would not function optimally. All telecommunication machines idle until they receive a signal, and all the machines are built with Hyperwave Filtering modules that allow for the scanning of signal's frequency regardless of intensity. This means each machine can selectively choose which signals to pay attention to, if there are any specified frequencies to tune into.\r\n</p>\r\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Subspace_Receivers\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Sreceiver.gif\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"Sreceiver.gif\" src=\"/wiki/images/c/c3/Sreceiver.gif\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"32\" height=\"32\" data-file-width=\"32\" data-file-height=\"32\" /></a> Subspace Receivers</span></h3>\r\n<p><i>Subspace Receivers</i> are essential to a subspace telecommunication network. They have a long-term subspace window open at all times, and create the subspace-equivalent of a gravity well in its warped version of space-time. FTL signals traveling in subspace are going too \"fast\" to be sucked into the gravity well, but a carbon copy of the signal is produced whenever a signal passes through the pocket. This signal is then converted into a real radio wave by the Subspace Receiver and passed onto either linked hubs or linked buses, with hubs having priority. In a typical scenario only the hub would receive the signal.  \r\n</p>\r\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Telecommunication_Relays\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Relay.gif\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"Relay.gif\" src=\"/wiki/images/0/04/Relay.gif\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"32\" height=\"32\" data-file-width=\"32\" data-file-height=\"32\" /></a> Telecommunication Relays</span></h3>\r\n<p><i>Telecommunication Relays</i> are very essential creating a full network. They allow the network to expand by being able to send signals past Z levels. Meaning that when saying something in the radio, after the message is received by the relay, it will be transmitted to all linked relays. It works by charging atoms for an almost faster than light signal. It then gets sent to the hub (if the hub is linked to a receiver), the only other telecomms machine that can receive these almost-light speed signals. When the signal is processed by the hub, it is broadcasted back using these relays.\r\n</p>\r\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Telecommunication_Hub\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Hub.gif\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"Hub.gif\" src=\"/wiki/images/1/16/Hub.gif\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"32\" height=\"32\" data-file-width=\"32\" data-file-height=\"32\" /></a> Telecommunication Hub</span></h3>\r\n<p><i>Telecommunication Hub</i> is the main junction for the network. It is connected to many relays that are scattered along space, waiting to send and receive information to and from buses, relays, and broadcasters. It uses a high level technology of circuits to send information as efficiently and as fast as possible.\r\n</p>\r\n<div class=\"thumb tleft\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:642px;\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:SpessChart.png\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/wiki/images/8/83/SpessChart.png\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" class=\"thumbimage\" data-file-width=\"640\" data-file-height=\"480\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:SpessChart.png\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>A simple visual synopsis of a basic radio telecommunication network.

They are not essential to a network, but are required to keep data transfer instant. They are necessary to transfer data back and forth between processor units and servers. If a Bus Mainframe is missing, network output may be unreliable or slow. \r\n</p>\r\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Processor_Units\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Pro.gif\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"Pro.gif\" src=\"/wiki/images/c/cc/Pro.gif\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"32\" height=\"32\" data-file-width=\"32\" data-file-height=\"32\" /></a> Processor Units</span></h3>\r\n<p><i>Processor Units</i> decrypt, clean and stretch hyper-compressed radio signals. Radio signals are sent into subspace using a preset encryption hash but random seed, which makes the process of encrypting and sending very light but unpacking and decrypting heavy due to the weird nature of subspace. Processor Units can instantly make signals readable by other machines. They are not essential to a subspace network but if one is missing, network output may not be understandable.\r\n</p>\r\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Telecommunication_Servers\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Server.gif\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"Server.gif\" src=\"/wiki/images/d/dd/Server.gif\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"32\" height=\"32\" data-file-width=\"32\" data-file-height=\"32\" /></a> Telecommunication Servers</span></h3>\r\n<p><i>Telecommunication Servers</i> log network statistics and signal traffic for easy maintenance. Each server represents a \"channel\" in the Nanotrasen default settings. They can listen in to multiple channels, however. For each signal that is sent to a server, a database entry is created and the signal's information is stored. The servers also help by sorting the order in which signals are transferred to subspace broadcasters, which is vital for instantaneous signal transferring.\r\n</p><p><i>Additionally</i>, Telecommunication Servers were capable of running user-written scripts (removed from /tg/-servers in 2015) through use of a Telecommunications Traffic Monitor. When a signal passes through a server (and the server is set to automatically execute code), the interpreter halts the signal until the code has finished executing, then releases the signal. During this time, the server's script interpreter can modify the signal's contents or flag it as a rejected signal, which will cause broadcasters to ignore it.\r\n</p>\r\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Subspace_Broadcasters\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Broad.gif\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"Broad.gif\" src=\"/wiki/images/0/06/Broad.gif\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"32\" height=\"32\" data-file-width=\"32\" data-file-height=\"32\" /></a> Subspace Broadcasters</span></h3>\r\n<p><i>Subspace Broadcasters</i> are impressive pieces of hardware that are capable of opening large enough subspace windows to transfer de-compressed data bursts, in encoded radio waves, through. They are necessary for any network that is expected to output information back to receiving radio devices. They operate by directing high-powered lasers into a small subspace window and fluctuating the amplitude of radio waves through subspace, allowing the large data packets easier entering and exiting of subspace.\r\n</p>\r\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Messaging_Servers\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Message_server_anim.gif\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"Message server anim.gif\" src=\"/wiki/images/c/c9/Message_server_anim.gif\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"32\" height=\"32\" data-file-width=\"32\" data-file-height=\"32\" /></a> Messaging Servers</span></h3>\r\n<p><i>Messaging Servers</i> process and route PDA and request console messages. Takes 15 minutes of calibration before it works if newly constructed. <br />Use a multitool to configure its settings and link it to the (tcommsat) network and hub. If there is no active messaging server, PDA and request console messages won't work.\r\n</p>\r\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Blackbox_Recorder\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Blackbox_recorder.gif\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"Blackbox recorder.gif\" src=\"/wiki/images/b/bd/Blackbox_recorder.gif\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"32\" height=\"32\" data-file-width=\"32\" data-file-height=\"32\" /></a> Blackbox Recorder</span></h3>\r\n<p>Only used for keeping <a href=\"/wiki/High-risk_items#The_Blackbox\" title=\"High-risk items\">The Blackbox</a> theft objective.\r\n</p>\r\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Maintenance_Guide\">Maintenance Guide</span></h2>\r\n<p>Telecommunications machines are flexible and can adapt to structure changes, and they are otherwise immortal to mundane errors and crashes. However, in the event of a catastrophe such as an explosion, singularity, or anything of the like the default warranty becomes void and the machines will probably be destroyed or totaled. If one or more machines are destroyed, chances are the entire communication grid or at least part of it will be down. While intercoms and station bounced radios are capable of limited non-subspace communication it is most definitely not reliable. It should be maximum priority to get those machines up again.\r\n</p><p>If you suspect the machines aren't working properly (or at all), you should identify the cause first. Probably the most common issue is an exploded central compartment. Repair any structural damage and assess the machines. If they're still on (flashing/blinking lights, etc) then they are relatively functional. If there's been some atmospheric depressurization you're going to want to pump supercooled air into room; the machines need cold gas to survive or they will not be able to diffuse their heat into the environment, and will overheat.\r\n</p>\r\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:276px;\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Multitool-tcomm.png\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/wiki/images/e/e2/Multitool-tcomm.png\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"274\" height=\"273\" class=\"thumbimage\" data-file-width=\"274\" data-file-height=\"273\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Multitool-tcomm.png\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>The multitool-telecomm interface.</div></div></div>\r\n<p>If the machines have been overheated, you can fix them by simply reconstructing them. To do this, first unfasten the exterior bolts with a screwdriver. Next, dislodge the plating with a wrench. Next, remove the internal cables with some wirecutters. After that, you can use a crowbar to remove the internal components and circuit board. From there, you can either deconstruct the empty frame or simply rebuild it. If the machines have been completely destroyed, you're going to want to build more. You're going to have to bug R&amp;D for some really high-tier circuit boards and stock parts, or salvage some parts from other toasted telecomm machines. Keep in mind, you don't have to reconstruct ALL the machines. At the very minimum you need 1 receiver, 1 processor, 1 bus, and 1 broadcaster. You might have to manually reconnect to relays if they are destroyed, this involves a long walk.\r\n</p>\r\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Telecommunication_Polymorphism\">Telecommunication Polymorphism</span></h2>\r\n<p>The machines can be retrofitted manually to work with other machines that normally would not be very common or wise. In the case of an emergency, however, it can be a life-saver. You can use a multitool to interface with telecommunication machines, which will allow you to modify some of the machines' properties. You can also link together machines with this interface, which is possibly the most important function.\r\n</p><p>In order to link two machines, access one of them with your multitool. Select [Add Machine] at the bottom of the window to store this machine in the buffer of the multitool. Now access the other machine with the same multitool. The machine previously buffered should still be in the buffer of the multitool. Select [Link] to add the machine currently buffered to the list of machine links of the machine currently accessed. This will establish a link between these two machines. (Note that it is possible to link a machine to itself; this is both harmless and pointless.)\r\n</p>\r\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Subspace_Receiver\">Subspace Receiver</span></h3>\r\n<p>You can link Subspace Receivers to either Buses or Hubs. If you want to send signals across z-levels, you'll need to link it to a hub that's linked to a relay. Otherwise, you can link it to a bus with no loss of functionality.\r\n</p>\r\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Bus_Mainframes_2\">Bus Mainframes</span></h3>\r\n<p>While it is technically optional, if you do not link the bus to a Processor Unit, signals' readability will suffer substantially. Linking to a processor is all but necessary.\r\n</p><p>You can link Bus Mainframes to the hub or directly to <i>Subspace Broadcasters</i> if you are unable to link to a functional server. Note that if you link directly to the broadcaster, relays connected to the hub won't be used and other z-levels won't receive the signal.  Otherwise, this will not have much of an effect besides a very minuscule performance decrease.\r\n</p>\r\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Processor_Units_2\">Processor Units</span></h3>\r\n<p>According to the code, you can link Processor Units to <i>Telecommunication Servers</i> instead of Bus Mainframes. This will naturally have a significant performance cost. However, since processors must be linked to buses to receive the information in the first place, using this feature isn't actually possible.\r\n</p>\r\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Telecommunication_Relay\">Telecommunication Relay</span></h3>\r\n<p>Relays must be connected to a Hub in order to add information to the signal about the Z level it is in, and which will broadcast in. It cannot be linked to any other machine usefully.\r\n</p>\r\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Telecommunication_Hub_2\">Telecommunication Hub</span></h3>\r\n<p>This machine is essential when creating relays that allow you to send and receive signals to and from different Z-levels. It is ordinarily connected to relays, receivers, buses, servers, and broadcasters. When it receives information from relays it sends it to linked receivers, and those receivers send it to the hub, and then the hub sends it to all linked buses. If the hub receives information from a machine that isn't a receiver (either the bus or a server), it assumes it's ready-to-transmit data and then sends it to all linked relays and broadcasters. \r\n</p>\r\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Telecommunication_Servers_2\">Telecommunication Servers</span></h3>\r\n<p>These can either be linked directly to a broadcaster or to a hub. They must be linked to the hub in order to broadcast information to relays on other z-levels, but otherwise there's no benefit. Servers are only needed to store logs and maintain sane bookkeeping.\r\n</p>\r\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Subspace_Broadcasters_2\">Subspace Broadcasters</span></h3>\r\n<p>Broadcasters are the output, there is nothing you can do with these in terms of polymorphism. \r\n</p>\r\n<h1><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Being_An_Ass\">Being An Ass</span></h1>\r\n<p>Now downing the radio may seem like something the captain does when he stubs his toe too hard, but downing the radios is something even the most <a href=\"/wiki/Assistant\" title=\"Assistant\">clueless trouble maker</a> can do, provided they have the tools. Here are some easy ways to make nobody hear the screams of the station's inhabitants.\r\n</p>\r\n<ul><li>Destroy the sub-space broadcaster. Those screams will be uttered, But not heard.</li></ul>\r\n<ul><li>Deconstruct the processor.
