To use an AI module, you must first find either an AI Upload or Cyborg Upload. <a href=\"/wiki/Cyborg\" title=\"Cyborg\">Cyborgs</a> have their laws synced with the <a href=\"/wiki/AI\" title=\"AI\">AI</a> by default, so the Cyborg Upload is only required if there are cyborgs that are cut free from their master. AIs that are <a href=\"/wiki/InteliCard\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"InteliCard\">carded</a> can have their laws changed as long as they have wireless enabled. Once you have either, you must click on the console to select an <a href=\"/wiki/AI\" title=\"AI\">AI</a>. Depending on the module, it may have some settings, so click on the module while you have it in your active hand. Once the required settings are set, with the module in your active hand, click on the AI Upload or Cyborg Upload.<br />\r\n</p><p>As of Feb 2020 you can also upload laws by slapping an AI core directly with an AI module. \r\n</p><p>Note that if the station is unfortunate enough to have a syndicate AI shipped and installed, it is impossible to fix. Even purging the AI's laws will not reset the AI, so feel free to laser it to death or card and wipe it.\r\n</p><p>If the <a href=\"/wiki/AI\" title=\"AI\">AI</a> has had its laws changed by someone during its time on board the station, then using a Reset module will restore the <a href=\"/wiki/AI\" title=\"AI\">AI</a> if it hasn't had its core laws altered. If its core laws have been changed, another core board is required to overwrite them.\r\n</p><p>Carding an AI will also disable it, and allow its laws to be checked. Avoid damaging or wiping the AI without good reason. AIs are players, who are protected by the server <a href=\"/wiki/Rules\" title=\"Rules\">rules</a>.\r\n</p>\r\n<div id=\"toc\" class=\"toc\" role=\"navigation\" aria-labelledby=\"mw-toc-heading\"><div class=\"toctitle\" lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><h2 id=\"mw-toc-heading\">Contents</h2><span class=\"toctogglespan\"><label class=\"toctogglelabel\" for=\"toctogglecheckbox\"></label></span></div>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-1\"><a href=\"#Law_Hierarchy\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Law Hierarchy</span></a>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-2\"><a href=\"#Standard_AI_Modules\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1.1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Standard AI Modules</span></a></li>\r\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-3\"><a href=\"#Special_AI_Modules\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1.2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Special AI Modules</span></a></li>\r\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-4\"><a href=\"#Core_AI_Modules\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1.3</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Core AI Modules</span></a>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li class=\"toclevel-3 tocsection-5\"><a href=\"#Antagonistic_Modules\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1.3.1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Antagonistic Modules</span></a></li>\r\n<li class=\"toclevel-3 tocsection-6\"><a href=\"#Neutral_Modules\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1.3.2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Neutral Modules</span></a></li>\r\n<li class=\"toclevel-3 tocsection-7\"><a href=\"#Station-Sided_Laws\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1.3.3</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Station-Sided Laws</span></a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-8\"><a href=\"#Interesting_AI_Lawsets\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Interesting AI Lawsets</span></a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Law_Hierarchy\">Law Hierarchy</span></h2>\r\n<p>It may be important to note how AIs interpret their laws in order to upload effective laws.\r\n</p><p>An AI follows its laws according to its priority.
