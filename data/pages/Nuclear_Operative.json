Your team should talk over about their plan of attack, but the leader should have the final say.\r\n</p><p><u>A couple of different approaching styles/ideas:</u>\r\n</p>\r\n<ul><li><b>Classic-style (Surprise Ops):</b> Silently infiltrate the station and sabotage coms/AI. Then come blazing out of maintenance guns-a-blazing after the person with the disk. The classic and most effective style.</li>\r\n<li><b>Infiltrator-style (Stealth Ops):</b> Silently infiltrate the station and acquire disguises, then change your Agent ID to a believable name. Assassinate the disk holder and nuke the station without the crew even knowing you're there. Very difficult to pull off and requires coordination.</li>\r\n<li><b>Hybrid-style (Split Ops):</b> Basically Classic-style, but with one ore more stealth operatives to blend in and try to nab the disk if the crew isn't watching their back. A useful tactic if the main team fails to get the disk.</li>\r\n<li><b>Assault-style (War Ops):</b> Have your leader declare war to grant your team a VERY large TC boost, at the cost of announcing your presence to the entire station and delaying your assault until the round has been going on for 20 minutes.</li>\r\n<li><b>Locker-style (Locker Ops):</b> Cram your whole team into a locker, have someone in disguise drag the locker to the station, unleash a locker full of syndies right in front of the Captain. What a nasty suprise! Bonus points if you use the <a href=\"/wiki/Delivery_Office\" title=\"Delivery Office\">Delivery Office</a> to mail your locker full of hurt to your target. (Fission Mailed operatives)</li>\r\n<li><b>Murderbone-style (Fluke Ops):</b> Just kill everything that doesn't have a red S over it. Will most likely result in your failure if you try to take on every damn crewmate. After a while the amount of toolboxes thrown into your head adds up.</li>\r\n<li><b>STEELRAIN-style (Pod Ops):</b> Use the drop pod located in the right side of the base to slam into a location of your choice on the station. CRASH AND BURN BABY, STEEL RAIN! Just make sure you have a way out!</li></ul>\r\n<p>These are just a few of the ways your team can try to get dat fukken disk. Experiment, come up with something different or more elaborate.\r\n</p><p><br />\r\n</p>\r\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"War_Were_Declared\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Gangtool_red.png\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"Gangtool red.png\" src=\"/wiki/images/c/cd/Gangtool_red.png\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"32\" height=\"32\" data-file-width=\"32\" data-file-height=\"32\" /></a> War Were Declared</span></h3>\r\n<p><i><b>Declaration of War</b> - \"<span style=\"color:red\">Cindy Kate has declared her intent to utterly destroy Space Station 13 with a nuclear device, and dares the crew to try and stop them.</span>\"</i>\r\n</p><p>The leader starts with a tool in his bag which can be used to declare war against the station. When activated, this alerts the crew that you're planning to kick down their door in about 20 minutes and gives the team a bonus of around 280 TC, depending on how many crewmembers there are. Declaring war doesn't change any of the above, except you lose the luxury of having time to come up with a plan and the element of surprise. Most times, declaring war means facing a completely armed and armored station hellbent on kicking your ass, so be sure to spend your Telecrystals wisely.\r\n</p>\r\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Communication\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Syndicate_headset.png\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"Syndicate headset.png\" src=\"/wiki/images/0/08/Syndicate_headset.png\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"32\" height=\"32\" data-file-width=\"32\" data-file-height=\"32\" /></a> Communication</span></h3>\r\n<p>You have a special radio frequency, set in an encrypted wavelength. This is how you will, and must communicate with your team. Communicate passwords, safewords, and attack plans on this channel early, there is no telling who might get the headset later.\r\n</p><p>Making code named strikes with your team can be an effective way to deal with the crew, but it is difficult.\r\n</p><p>Safewords can be said if you see a comrade but both of you are disguised. \"Shamalama dingdong!\" or something - fast, and easy to say. The phonetic alphabet can also be useful for this, as in Alpha - A, Bravo - B, Charlie - C and so on.\r\n</p><p>Passwords are only useful if you have a door guard in the Infiltrator. Make it as you want, said over the Syndicate frequency.\r\n</p><p>Alternatively, purchase a <a href=\"/wiki/Syndicate_items#Codespeak_Manual\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Syndicate items\">Codespeak Manual</a> and speak in codespeak to prevent any crewmembers with the syndicate frequency from hearing you.\r\n</p><p>The Syndicate radio channel is shared by other agents if any are present, including Lavaland Communications Agents, normal traitors who purchase the syndicate encryption key item with telecrystals, and even malfunctioning AI units. Consider cooperating with them if they talk in your channel.\r\n</p>\r\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Ordering_Gear_as_a_Team\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Radio.png\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"Radio.png\" src=\"/wiki/images/3/31/Radio.png\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"32\" height=\"32\" data-file-width=\"32\" data-file-height=\"32\" /></a> Ordering Gear as a Team</span></h3>\r\n<p>The operatives will get an amount of bonus telecrystals <a href=\"/wiki/File:Tc.png\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"Tc.png\" src=\"/wiki/images/f/fe/Tc.png\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"32\" height=\"32\" data-file-width=\"32\" data-file-height=\"32\" /></a> based on the round population, allowing nuke op equipment to scale with the increased threat of a fully-manned station.\r\n</p><p>Each operative spawns with a personal Syndicate Uplink radio <a href=\"/wiki/File:Radio.png\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"Radio.png\" src=\"/wiki/images/3/31/Radio.png\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"32\" height=\"32\" data-file-width=\"32\" data-file-height=\"32\" /></a> with 25 Telecrystals pre-loaded. If war is declared, everyone will gain a large amount of extra TC, automatically evenly distributed. <br />\r\n</p><p>Pause and think hard. Which <a href=\"/wiki/Syndicate_Items\" title=\"Syndicate Items\">Syndicate Items</a> will you need? Which can cause a huge backlash if used against your team? Now, consider what everyone else will likely need. The problem with the agent ID is the access -- you have very little, but an airlock auth override card (doormag), jaws of life, powersink or stolen high-ranking ID will change that in a moment. You do not have an ID or a position at the station, so don't worry about people finding the broken doors. Everyone on the team should have either a doormag or a jaws of life. The chameleon kit isn't an available option for sneaking in as a Nuke Op, but other items such as a chameleon projector, stealth implant, or simply a change of clothing can work just as well. Bombs are great in the right hands. Energy swords, especially if you purchase double-bladed eswords, are good for blocking enemy fire - but can be easily turned against you if an assistant gets a lucky disarm in. It is likely you may take damage, which is when the usefulness of the medigun and medkits come into play. Syndicate borgs are great tanks, and are even more robust if you have a welder, but are at great risk from ion rifle shots, emps and flashes/flashbangs, and can even be turned against you if they die. Mechs are devastating assault option that can soak up tons of damage and dish out just the same, but are rendered almost useless if Security remembers they have the ion rifle. Getting geared up as a team is all about balancing what the entire team has, making sure that most concerns like access, firepower, recovery, distractions, etc. are all addressed.\r\n</p>\r\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Equipment\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Chest_rig.png\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"Chest rig.png\" src=\"/wiki/images/8/86/Chest_rig.png\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"32\" height=\"32\" data-file-width=\"32\" data-file-height=\"32\" /></a> Equipment</span></h2>\r\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:402px;\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Nuke_shuttle.png\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/wiki/images/thumb/b/b2/Nuke_shuttle.png/400px-Nuke_shuttle.png\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"400\" height=\"541\" class=\"thumbimage\" srcset=\"/wiki/images/b/b2/Nuke_shuttle.png 1.5x\" data-file-width=\"544\" data-file-height=\"736\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Nuke_shuttle.png\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>The Syndicate Infiltrator, your ship.<br />Green: Tools<br />Blue: Explosives (Syndicate bombs, C-4 and Syndie Minibombs)<br />Purple: Your blood-red hardsuits<br />Yellow: Medical equipment and surgery<br />Red: The nuclear fission explosive.

It can be fired fully automatic, which can be used to great effect when providing covering fire for your team. Or just, y'know, shooting into crowds of people. Remember, no Russian.

Long range sniper rifle with a mounted scope. 6-round magazine, default .50 ammo deals 70 damage per bullet that knocks people off their feet on impact, with a chance to dismember targets. Comes with two kinds of alternative ammo for either penetrating through walls and structures or putting targets to sleep.

The Propelled Munitions Launcher, AKA a god damn RPG.

Has a far more expensive 84mm HEDP Rocket as alternative ammo that deals 80 damage on contact, has a stronger explosion, and deals incredible damage to armored targets like mechs or cyborgs (or perhaps the Captain, hehe). While the launcher itself isn't super expensive, the ammo costs add up quickly at 2 Telecrystals for each standard HE rocket and <b>6</b> Telecrystals for a single HEDP rockets.

The double energy sword is an immensely powerful weapon, capable of sending unarmored victims into critical in just 3 hits (and likely stunning them, dismembering, or knocking them unconscious long before that). Wielding it grants you a 50% chance to block melee attacks, and energy projectiles like lasers and disabler shots will deflect off the blade.

This is a very powerful asset, it will deflect all energy based ranged attacks, laser or stun. This makes it significantly harder for station personnel to attack or subdue you at range as only the armory's riot shotguns (or autorifles if they bought any from cargo) will be effective in bypassing the energy shield.

Reading this single-use book will teach you the basics of CQC - a martial art. You learn devastating combos and when throw is active, have a chance to block and counter attacks.

The Infiltrator comes prestocked with a ton of these.

Standard issue syndicate chameleon ID card given to all operatives. Can be adjusted to disguise as any name/job, but only comes with inherent access to the station's maintenance areas, the base, and the Infiltrator. Using it on other IDs (looted from the crew) allows you to copy up to 5 ID access codes to the agent ID. Useful for steath operations when trying to disguise as station crew. Don't lose this!

If one of your team goes down and a crew member manages to get access to the Syndicate radio channel, they'll be unable to understand a word you and your team is saying.

When attached to a gun, no message is given when you fire it, making it possible to gun people down before they realize what's happening. The sound when fired also is different and much quieter, making it much harder for people to hear at a distance. The only trade off is that it makes the weapon longer and can prevent it from being equipped in some storage slots. Can be fitted to weapons such as the Makarov Pistol, C-20r Submachine Gun, or the Sniper Rifle. Remove it by alt-clicking the firearm. Note that some bundles come with this included already.</li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://tgstation13.org/wiki/File:Chameleon_projector.gif\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img alt=\"Chameleon projector.gif\" src=\"/wiki/images/d/d4/Chameleon_projector.gif\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"32\" height=\"32\" data-file-width=\"32\" data-file-height=\"32\" /></a> Chameleon Projector -- <b>7 Telecrystals</b>. A handheld personal holographic projector useful in stealth applications. Using the Chameleon Projector on an item will disguise you as that item. While disguised you move at walk speed and cannot interact with anything you're not already holding. People can walk over you without ruining the disguise. If someone tries to pick you up the disguise fails and you change back to normal. The AI also cannot track you while disguised. The item it defaults to is a cigarette butt. In a pinch can be used to completely vanish from any pursuer that might be after you, or can be used to set up an ambush. Note that after using the projector it makes a slight clicking sound and a small particle effect that lingers for a second. This could give away to your pursuer that you used your projector and are likely to check nearby items.</li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://tgstation13.org/wiki/File:Emag.png\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img alt=\"Emag.png\" src=\"/wiki/images/2/2d/Emag.png\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"32\" height=\"32\" data-file-width=\"32\" data-file-height=\"32\" /></a> Cryptographic Sequencer (Emag) -- <b>4 Telecrystals.</b> While it no longer has it's airlock opening powers, it still can see some utility in hacking station equipment as it can still break/bypass most other kinds of ID locks.

This is a specially made emag designed to exclusively break open airlocks regardless of their ID restrictions. Has 3 separate charges that recharge individually on a 3 minute timer, examining it will display the time remaining for each recharge. Note that using it on airlocks that are physically unable to open (bolts are dropped, welded shut) will simply break the door, keeping it shut for good. Useful for quickly making an entryway into areas your team has yet to steal access for.</li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://tgstation13.org/wiki/File:Syndicate_jaws.png\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img alt=\"Syndicate jaws.png\" src=\"/wiki/images/d/d7/Syndicate_jaws.png\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"32\" height=\"32\" data-file-width=\"32\" data-file-height=\"32\" /></a> Syndicate Jaws of Life -- <b>4 Telecrystals.</b> A set of compact high power jaws for prying open powered airlocks and cutting apart things. Prying open an airlock takes a few seconds to complete uninterrupted and makes a noisy, distinct sound, but can be performed infinitely with no cooldown. The airlocks take only slight damage each time, and will close normally after a while. A great alternative to the doormag that makes up for the downtime a recharging doormag usually has.</li></ul>\r\n<h4><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Heavy_Fire_Support:\"><u>Heavy Fire Support:</u></span></h4>\r\n<p>The Mechs, the biggest and baddest.

This does not point toward the nuclear disk like the nuke op pinpointers did - instead, this points towards the nearest nuclear operative. If a syndiborg is lost or the radio is dead silent, they can use the pinpointer to find their way to an operative. Of course, it does have drawbacks, like not discriminating between a Syndicate corpse and a Syndicate operative, as well as a tendency to stick to the same operative. However, it's very useful for coordinating with your team, and since it has no power draw it should be kept active at all times.\r\n</p>\r\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Actually_Getting_There\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Shuttle_1.gif\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"Shuttle 1.gif\" src=\"/wiki/images/e/ee/Shuttle_1.gif\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"32\" height=\"32\" data-file-width=\"32\" data-file-height=\"32\" /></a> Actually Getting There</span></h2>\r\n<p>Alright, your team has a plan, you've geared up, and you're ready to get dat fukken disk.

Pick and chose from...\r\n</p>\r\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"The_Syndicate_Infiltrator\">The Syndicate Infiltrator</span></h3>\r\n<p>The Syndicate Infiltrator is the standard ship that operatives use to conduct their clandestine operations. It's controlled using the syndicate shuttle terminal in the cockpit, which can be used to travel a point near the station for it to jump. There is an additional console allowing the creation of a custom destination around the station. The Infiltrator itself is outfitted with powerful turrets which fire damaging penetrator rounds at anything that isn't an operative, as well as only one entrance that can be sealed with a blast door to keep those who somehow bypass the turrets from getting in.\r\n</p><p>When choosing a spot to send the ship, make sure your team is going to remember where it is and that it is mostly out of sight for those in EVA on the outside of the station. Many an operative has gotten lost in deep space because the Infiltrator was put somewhere weird.\r\n</p>\r\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"The_Assault_Pod\">The Assault Pod</span></h3>\r\n<p>Grab your team, cram into the pod, select your area and launch. You'll be on station within seconds, obliterating anything unfortunate enough to be caught in the way. The pod is also lined with turrets that fire on anyone not Syndicate, so even if you don't land on them they will likely be caught in a hailstorm of bullets. From there it's a simple matter of assaulting the crew and cornering whatever poor bastard has the disk. \r\n</p><p>Caveat emptor: The assault pod is a <b>one way trip</b> so make sure you have an exit strategy. When taking the assault pod, always be sure that one operative flies the shuttle close to the station so the assault team have a way out after the disk has been secured. \r\n</p><p><br />\r\n</p>\r\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Dat_Fukken_Disk\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:NuclearDisk.gif\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"NuclearDisk.gif\" src=\"/wiki/images/6/6b/NuclearDisk.gif\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"32\" height=\"32\" data-file-width=\"32\" data-file-height=\"32\" /></a> Dat Fukken Disk</span></h2>\r\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:130px;\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Disk512.gif\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/wiki/images/thumb/4/46/Disk512.gif/128px-Disk512.gif\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"128\" height=\"117\" class=\"thumbimage\" srcset=\"/wiki/images/4/46/Disk512.gif 1.5x\" data-file-width=\"192\" data-file-height=\"176\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Disk512.gif\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>EAT THIS.</div></div></div>\r\n<p>Alright.

A block of C4 will knock down any wall and seriously wound whoever's on the other side.\r\n</p><p>If you're in the bag for a more elaborate ruse, have one of your team members cause a ruckus in a <a href=\"/wiki/Armory\" title=\"Armory\">secure area</a>, forcing the disk carrier to flee right into the arms of your waiting team members.\r\n</p><p>Don't be afraid to think outside the box! This game mode in particular lends itself to unconventional approaches.\r\n</p><p><b>If you declared War</b>, be prepared for the possibility that the crew took extra precautions to make sure the disk was annoying as possible to get/find. They could have stashed it in a box inside of a backpack filled with boxes, in a locker filled with backpacks (also filled with boxes), inside a locked/welded/wrapping paper covered locker in a secure room filled with lockers. Or they could have surgically shoved the disk into the chest cavity of the Clown for safe keeping. Who knows!

Do so as soon as possible and then put the tablet in your inventory somewhere you can see it.

More often than not this ends up being a suicide mission, but occasionally the Syndicate gets lucky and manages to destroy a few stations here and there for the fraction of the assets. Thus, the practice of sending \"Lone Operatives\" still takes place to this day, instilling fear into Captains with one simple passing thought: \"did I secure the disk?\"\r\n</p><p>As the name implies, Lone Operatives consist of a single nuclear operative. They appear extremely rarely on their own (or perhaps never at all) at random controlled by a player selected from ghosts. <b>The chance of a lone operative being sent to the station increases the longer the Nuclear Authentication Disk stays still</b>. Lone Operatives start in space somewhere around the station equipped with standard issue gear (makarov, knife, jet harness, agent ID, NVG goggles, pinpointer, uplink, Syndicate MODsuit), but come already wearing their MODsuit with an expanded capacity oxygen tank. They are armed with a Bulldog Shotgun right off the bat, but they can chose to purchase other weapons if they desire. \r\n</p><p>With no ship, no nuke, and no extra free gear, how are they supposed to detonate the station?\r\n</p><p>Thankfully, Syndicate intelligence officers from <a href=\"/wiki/MI13\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"MI13\">MI13</a> were able to obtain codes for SS13's onboard Self Destruct Device, located in the station's <a href=\"/wiki/Vault\" title=\"Vault\">Vault</a> (detonating this has the added bonus of making the detonation seem like a regular self destruct, committing insurance fraud against NT). Impractical to access with a full strike team, but for a single, stealthier operative getting closer to the guarded vault is a more realistic option. Just like the nuke, all a lone operative has to do is steal the disk, slot it into the Self Destruct, punch in the code and set a timer, and let it rip.\r\n</p><p>This is no simple task. While the disk might still be sitting still in the captain's office or wherever it got lost, a lone operative is only one person with a limited TC budget comparable to that of a traitor.\r\n</p><p>Lone Operatives as such are extremely limited on what options they can take. They can go loud and come in guns blazing, but ammo is limited and they're only one person vs. the entire Security force and the rest of the crew. Taking a stealthy approach is harder to pull off, but is extremely effective as a lone operative as you can sneak around and steal items from the station to aid in your nuking attempt. Plus, there's no other teammates that might fuck it all up and ruin the stealth operation. Either way, time is of the essence as at any moment someone could remember they don't have the disk and could come looking for it.\r\n</p><p>Once a lone operative activates the Self Destruct Device, they are recommended to run quickly as all eyes will be on the Vault once the Delta alert rings out. Evade being captured and/or killed and avoid letting the disk get back into the hands of the crew. If the SD goes off, the lone operative wins the Syndicate a victory regardless if they perish in the blast or not.\r\n</p>\r\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Tips\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Light_Bulb.png\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"Light Bulb.png\" src=\"/wiki/images/2/2c/Light_Bulb.png\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"32\" height=\"32\" data-file-width=\"32\" data-file-height=\"32\" /></a>Tips</span></h2>\r\n<ul><li>Set your ID to a crew member. Give it a legit job. Set your fucking ID to a fucking crew member's name and give it an actual job like Chemist or something.</li>\r\n<li>The gloves you start with are already insulated, and so are your MODsuit gloves.</li>\r\n<li>For the love of all that is holy, do not lose your ID, otherwise you'll end up locked out of the Syndicate Shuttle while the nuke timer ticks down.</li>\r\n<li>Thermal glasses will make you vulnerable to being flashed, even with your hardsuit helmet on. NVGs do not.</li>\r\n<li>The black-and-red space suit is good for inserting a stealth OP onto the station. The crew is less likely to go into a panic at the sight of a regular space suit rather than the iconic blood-red MODsuit.</li>\r\n<li>Always bring C4/X4. There are few things more embarassing than an operative that gets stopped by a bolted airlock.</li>\r\n<li>Your cyborgs can also remotely interact with machines just like regular cyborgs. If you get bolted down by the AI, they can open the way for you.</li>\r\n<li>Be careful of falling behind and getting lost in space. If you get lost, use your pinpointer to guide you.</li>\r\n<li>To talk with your team, just talk as if you wanted to talk on the standard radio channel by using the <b>;</b> prefix, your headset is different and only your team will hear you. <b>:t</b> can also be used if you add a syndicate key to a normal headset.</li>\r\n<li>Subvert or destroy the AI first. It can give you away. Syndicate borgs are able to dispose of the AI without it screaming for help over the comms, and a sniper with thermals and penetrator rounds will do the job just as well.</li>\r\n<li>Make sure the Escape Shuttle can't be called and then you can't technically lose!</li>\r\n<li>Always keep in communication with your team. Having backup and knowledge of what's happening from both the Syndicate and loyal station fronts goes a long way towards an easy victory and far outweighs the damage someone who stole a Syndicate headset can do.</li>\r\n<li>Installing a power sink on the station is a popular strategy. Make sure you bring night-vision goggles and a crowbar!</li>\r\n<li>Taking out telecommunications is a good way to ensure the crew remains confused and disorganized.</li>\r\n<li>Ignore the nuke in the vault on the station. It has a completely different code, and without an admin checking the var and giving it to you, it would be impossible to activate (yes, impossible. the code only generates if an admin or something forces the creation of the code).</li>\r\n<li>For the love of fuck do not mistake a Tech Disk/Genetics Data Disk for the Nuke Disk. Examine the disk and check your pinpointer to ensure you have the real deal.</li>\r\n<li>Do not buy a mech unless you are absolutely sure you are capable of making it an asset. It is suggested that you blow out the back of the armory to steal the Ion Gun, as that alone can invalidate any mech it fires at.</li>\r\n<li>Use the red button found in your base to instantly blow up all deployed syndicate bombs in the game.</li>\r\n<li>If you know that the station has cyborgs, bring a flashbang or ten. Flashbangs are very effective at taking out cyborgs, and you can emag-crowbar-emag the stunned cyborg to subvert it. The ion gun found at the base is also good for this.</li>\r\n<li>Purchasing No-Slip shoes is always a good idea; getting dunked on by the clown because you slipped on a banana peel is not the best way to go out.</li>\r\n<li>You can quickly and quietly rob the armory by applying c4 to the wall from space. No loud beeping. No ruckus. C4, grab the guns, get out.</li>\r\n<li>If going stealth, the regular headsets in the locker room come pre-loaded with a Syndie key. Chameleon headsets don't.</li>\r\n<li>Saboteur Cyborgs don't have a built in cryptographic sequencer, meaning they cannot hack station borgs. They can still however easily flash the other borgs while disguised so they can bring them to a disguised operative who can.</li>\r\n<li>The L6 SAW is a monster of a weapon compared to most guns available in the game. A full three round burst is a guaranteed crit even at full health, and it can sometimes still achieve this even when they have armor. Hold a chokepoint like a doorway or a long maintenance tunnel and lure crew into it. Gun them down.</li>\r\n<li>Don't let yourself get stripped. Your explosive implant can be triggered even in stunlock or critical. Letting yourself get looted is a surefire way to fuck your team over and get laughed at in dchat.</li>\r\n<li>Macrobomb implants are not the worst idea if you don't expect to live. Lure a bunch of crew into fighting you in an important area, and upon death watch as the blast wipes the screen of everything who didn't hear the beeping.</li>\r\n<li>You can purchase a novelty Broken Chameleon Kit. They gave all the good ones for Traitors, leaving you with the malfunctioning ones. Makes you stick out like a sore thumb, perfect for combo-ing with your Syndicate balloon.</li>\r\n<li>You can purchase an old set of CentCom official gear. Likely taken right off the back of captured CentCom officials, this can actually be useful in faking a group inspection. Just ensure you set your agent ID properly and make whatever you're doing quick, as the Captain may directly contact Central Command to confirm the legitimacy of your \"nuclear authentication disk inspection\".</li>\r\n<li>You can purchase a full clown costume. Wearing this will be enough to terrify most crew members.</li></ul>\r\n<p><br />\r\n</p>\r\n<table width=\"100%\" border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"2\">\r\n\r\n<tbody><tr>\r\n<td rowspan=\"12\" align=\"center\"><b><a href=\"/wiki/Jobs\" title=\"Jobs\">Jobs</a> on /tg/station</b><br />\r\n<p><a href=\"/wiki/Jobs\" title=\"Jobs\"><img alt=\"Jobstemp.png\" src=\"/wiki/images/8/85/Jobstemp.png\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"64\" height=\"64\" data-file-width=\"64\" data-file-height=\"64\" /></a>\r\n</p></td></tr><tr>\r\n<td style=\"background: #334E6D;
