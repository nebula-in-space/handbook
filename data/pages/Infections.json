Seek the isolation bay of the medical wing, or head to a room no one will enter but yourself and other infected.\r\n</p>\r\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Sterilization\">Sterilization</span></h3>\r\n<p>Cleaning blood spills from the ground will prevent contact contamination, make sure blood is cleaned from the floor at all time. Any blood splatter out there could hold a dreaded space infection. Contact a <a href=\"/wiki/Janitor\" title=\"Janitor\">janitor</a> if you see blood on the floor, do not interact with the blood if you suspect possible infection chance. Any object or floor that has infected blood on it can infect anyone who handles or touches it.\r\n</p>\r\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Sanitization\">Sanitization</span></h3>\r\n<p>Rotting things such as gibs or corpses can cause nasty diseases if you touch them. These can override your own viruses if their Transmission is higher than your virus' Resistance. Wearing mask/gloves while interacting with corpses may help prevent infection.\r\n</p>\r\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Methods_of_Infection\">Methods of Infection</span></h3>\r\n<p>The following are the various ways a disease can spread, keep this in mind at all times:\r\n</p>\r\n<ul><li>Airborne - The most dangerous and quick spreading, if you are anywhere within the breathing area of the infected crew member, you have a chance to be infected unless you use internals.</li>\r\n<li>Touch - Requires you to touch, have been touched, or be extremely close to the source of the infection. Hugging someone or switching places with someone has a chance to spread the infection. The infection will be spread by the skin and bodily fluids of an infected person, but will not survive long in the air.</li>\r\n<li>Fluid - Lets you infect someone by splashing them with infected blood, using smoke, sharing a drinking glass or them stepping barefoot in an infected person's vomit or blood splatter. Works even if they have internals on. Does not work through hardsuits.</li>\r\n<li>Blood - The infection will only be spread by ingesting infected blood.</li>\r\n<li>Special - The disease is not normally contagious and the affected crewman has been infected by a non-human vector source. You can work with the infected without risk yourself unless they expose you to the same vector source that infected them.</li></ul>\r\n<p>Any higher level infection method can infect using any lower level methods. For example, an airborne virus can spread to people with internals on by hugging them.\r\n</p>\r\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Natural_Recovery_and_Cures\">Natural Recovery and Cures</span></h3>\r\n<p>As of <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/pull/79854\">a rework on 12/6/2023,</a> infections from many diseases will eventually cure themselves over time. <i>This does not apply to most of the 'Simple Diseases' listed below or to the <a href=\"/wiki/Sentient_Disease\" title=\"Sentient Disease\">Sentient Disease</a> antagonist.</i>\r\n</p><p>You have several ways to offset the effects of diseases as well as to speed or slow this process.\r\n</p>\r\n<ul><li><a href=\"/wiki/Food#Hunger\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Food\">Food</a> - Being starved or eating junk food will make you more susceptible to disease and less able to naturally recover. Eating and being well-fed will make you recover faster.</li>\r\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/Mood\" title=\"Mood\">Mood</a> - Being in a good state of mind (high sanity) will help you recover from disease faster. Being in a bad state of mind (low sanity) will make you less able to naturally recover.</li>\r\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/Sleep\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Sleep\">Rest</a> - Sleeping (or unconsciousness of any kind) will temporarily stop symptoms from occurring and make you recover from a disease faster. Rest loses effectiveness as a way of stopping symptoms from occurring over time but will always assist in natural recovery. Resting in better conditions (in a bed, with a blanket, with a pillow, in the dark, with earmuffs - etc.) all help you recover from disease faster.</li>\r\n<li>Medicine - <a href=\"/wiki/Spaceacillin\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Spaceacillin\">Spaceacillin</a>, available at Medical, in biohazard gear closets, and through Cargo, has several effects:\r\n<ul><li>It slows the advancement of your disease.</li>\r\n<li>It makes you less likely to spread or catch diseases.</li>\r\n<li>It stops symptoms from occurring with decreasing effectiveness over time - so it can be used to temporarily buy yourself relief from a bad disease.</li>\r\n<li>It increases the speed of natural recovery from disease with decreasing effectiveness over time - so it's best used to help finally kill off a disease, or in combination with other methods listed above, to maximize its likely effect if used in this way.</li></ul></li></ul>\r\n<p>Natural recovery using these methods will provide lasting resistance/immunity to the disease <b>unless you are starving or malnourished, in which case, it's a coin-flip - if you lose the coin-flip, you may be reinfected even after recovering.</b> \r\n</p><p><i>Benign viruses - those with a Severity stat of 0 that show up with a blue smiling face on medical HUDs (see the section on Advanced Diseases below) will not go away by the above methods except:</i>\r\n</p>\r\n<ul><li><i>if you have taken Spaceacillin, or,</i></li>\r\n<li><i>if you are starving and/or malnourished (usually as a result of eating junk food.)</i></li></ul>\r\n<p>Take care of yourself!\r\n</p><p>Additionally, the blood of cured survivors - those who are already immune to the disease and whose blood can be used to make a vaccine (see below) - can be used to 'cure' a disease through direct injection or ingestion. <b>This does not confer lasting immunity to the person receiving the blood,</b> but it can buy valuable time and allow you to stop an outbreak as long as you can keep patients from getting reinfected. \r\n</p>\r\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Curing_an_infection\">Curing an infection</span></h3>\r\n<p>Every infection is vulnerable to one substance (or combination of two). To find it, you can put an infected blood sample in the PanD.E.M.I.C 2200 machine or use a health analyzer on an infected patient.

This involves adding a chemical to the virus, which will generate a new symptom. Rarer and harder to acquire chemicals will yield more potent symptoms. You will start with enough chemicals to create a powerful disease, as long as you use them carefully. You can also insert an isolated symptom into your main virus, by moving 1 unit of the isolated culture to the main mix with a dropper. It will not work every time and may need to be repeated a few times. \r\n</p>\r\n<h4><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Basic_chemicals\">Basic chemicals</span></h4>\r\n<p>These are the basic chemicals for virus mutation. You can either add them directly to a virus to obtain a random level symptom, or mix them with other ingredients to get <a href=\"/wiki/Guide_to_chemistry#Virology_Recipes\" title=\"Guide to chemistry\">advanced chemicals</a>, that will give you a specific level symptom.\r\n</p>\r\n<ul><li><b><a href=\"/wiki/Virus_Food\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Virus Food\">Virus Food</a></b>: You can make virus food with Water and Milk.

It's important if you intend to isolate a specific symptom. For example, if you mutate your Cold virus and it acquires the Toxic Filter symptom, you can try and add synaptizine to it to create a virus which only has the Toxic Filter symptom.\r\n</p>\r\n<h4><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Formaldehyde\"><a href=\"/wiki/Guide_to_chemistry#Formaldehyde\" title=\"Guide to chemistry\">Formaldehyde</a></span></h4>\r\n<p>Formaldehyde will neuter one random symptom when mixed with a virus. This disables its effects while keeping the attributes intact. This is useful for meeting threshold values without making the virus deadly.\r\n</p>\r\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Tips_and_Techniques\">Tips and Techniques</span></h2>\r\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Dropper\">Dropper</span></h3>\r\n<p>When you're adding a chemical to a virus, <b>you only need to add a single unit of it</b>. This means you can use a dropper to add a single unit at a time, instead of using a syringe and wasting 5 units at a time. Since Liquid Plasma and Mutagen are in limited supply, it is a smart move to conserve your chemicals.\r\nRemember, you have to use the dropper in your hand once to set its transfer value to 1 unit.\r\n</p>\r\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Mixing_in_Beakers\">Mixing in Beakers</span></h3>\r\n<p>While your first instict may be to create a new culture bottle, adding a chemical to it and scrapping the whole bottle if it's not the symptom you want, it is a slow process due to the Pandemic's cooldown. A better way is to instead keep a culture bottle, an empty beaker, and a bottle of your desired chemical; add one unit of culture to the beaker and then mutate it with the chemical, and check the result. Then repeat until you have to replicate the culture bottle: this allows for 20 uninterrupted tries before having to make a copy.\r\n</p>\r\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Chemical_Efficiency\">Chemical Efficiency</span></h3>\r\n<p>You don't always have to isolate every single symptom you want into your virus and then begin the slow process of combining them one by one. You start with just 30u Synaptizine and Unstable Mutagen on your workplace (Plasma amounts vary per map, but you also have a 30u liquid plasma bottle as backup inside your chemfridge) and once those run out, you have to beg chemistry (or mining) for more. To prevent this, once you got your first wanted symptom isolated, create a sample bottle out of it and use THAT bottle to combine with the other chemicals until you get your first symptom AND your desired second symptom on it, create a bottle with those two, use THAT new bottle to combine with the next chemical for your third symptom and so on.\r\nE.G: If you want your virus to have Viral Evolutionary Acceleration, Eternal Youth and Self Respiration, you combine your Rhinovirus blood sample with 1u of Mutagenic Agar until you get Sneezing and Viral Evolutionary Acceleration on your bottle. <a href=\"/wiki/Infections#Isolating_Symptoms\" title=\"Infections\">Isolate</a> the V.E.A. symptom and create a sample bottle of it. Then take 1u from the V.E.A. bottle and combine with 1u of Weakened Virus Plasma until you get Eternal Youth. Create a sample bottle of V.E.A.+Eternal Youth, and begin using it to combine with 1u of Plasma Virus until you get VEA+Eternal Youth+Self Respiration.\r\n</p>\r\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Isolating_Symptoms\">Isolating Symptoms</span></h3>\r\n<p>To isolate a single symptom, combine equal units of a blood sample with one of the two symptoms you want to isolate with equal parts of synaptizine (ideally you should <b>always</b> work with 1u at a time) and slap the beaker unto the PanD.E.M.I.C to check if it got isolated. You can then hit the create culture bottle button to make a bottle with just one symptom, or eject it as is and <a href=\"/wiki/Infections#Neutering_Symptoms\" title=\"Infections\">neuter</a> it if it's a bad symptom you only want stats out of.\r\n</p>\r\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Neutering_Symptoms\">Neutering Symptoms</span></h3>\r\n<p>To neuter a symptom, you combine 1u of your isolated symptom with 1u of Formalehyde, and the symptom gets \"neutered\", meaning it won't cause whatever effects they have, but will contribute to the virus' overall stats with theirs. That means that <b>Fever (Neutered)</b> will not make the subject \"feel hot\", but it will grant the virus no stealth bonuses, +3 resistance, +3 stage speed and +2 transmission. This is recommended to make your virus a completely \"positive\" virus by only having good symptoms or their ones neutered, which will make them appear with a blue smiley face on your doctor's medical HUD's, and also drastically reduce your chances of getting lynched.\r\n</p>\r\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Multiple_symptoms\">Multiple symptoms</span></h3>\r\n<p>A virus can have up to six symptoms. Trying to add a seventh symptom to a virus will instead make it replace one random existing symptom.\r\n</p>\r\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Understanding_stats\">Understanding stats</span></h2>\r\n<p>After you're done mixing your disease, stats from the symptoms are added together to make disease stats. Viruses with no symptoms have a default of 0 in every stat (except for those created by the <a href=\"/wiki/Sentient_Disease\" title=\"Sentient Disease\">Sentient Disease</a> antagonist - which have an additional buffer to their Stealth stat and require careful monitoring to catch their spread.)\r\n</p>\r\n<ul><li><b>Stealth:</b> If stealth is 2 or higher your disease will be hidden from medHUD and scanners. Generally it will also hide the warning signs of symptoms before they activate.</li>\r\n<li><b>Transmission:</b> Improves the chance each tick to spread the virus, increases the amount of protection you need to prevent infection, determines the infection vector, and is needed to override other viruses.\r\n<ul><li>The infection vector is calculated based on the disease's transmission stat. 3+ lets the virus spread via fluid contact, 7+ lets the virus spread via skin contact, and 11+ allows the virus to spread via the \"airborne\" infection vector. All advanced viruses can spread via the \"blood\" transmission vector. Note that these infection vectors are all cumulative; a virus with a transmission stat of 4 will have both the blood and the fluid contact transmission vectors. The sneezing and coughing symptoms (and the threshold effects of a few other symptoms) force sporadic airborne spreads (sneezing spreads the virus in a cone, while coughing spreads the virus in all directions, but considerably less far from the host than sneezing does), but do not otherwise affect this.</li>\r\n<li>When infecting someone who already has a virus, if the infecting virus' Transmission is higher than the other virus' Resistance, the latter will be overridden by the former.</li></ul></li>\r\n<li><b>Stage speed:</b> Increases the chance of advancing a stage each tick. It will be 2% or stage speed, whichever is higher.</li>\r\n<li><b>Resistance:</b> Makes the virus harder to cure; determines the required chemical to cure, decreases the chance of it being cured each tick when in contact with the cure, and defines how resistant the virus is to being overridden by other viruses.</li>\r\n<li><b>Severity:</b> A hidden statistic. The sum of severities of active symptoms, the virus's total overall stats (not including stealth,) and the fraction of symptoms on the virus out of the total possible symptoms (i.e. 1/6 or 6/6) determine a virus's severity; it affects the color of the medHUD icon, ranging from blue for positive viruses, to flashing red for extremely deadly diseases. It also determines the rate of natural recovery and how quickly a virus might self-cure.\r\n<ul><li>The chance of it being cured every tick is 7.5 - (resistance / 2), but will always be between 5 and 10.</li>\r\n<li>The cure is determined by [resistance - (amount of symptoms / 2)]. One chemical from the tier is randomly picked.</li></ul></li></ul>\r\n<table class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\">\r\n<tbody><tr>\r\n<td>Resistance tier</td>\r\n<td>Possible cures</td></tr><tr>\r\n<td>1 or less</td>\r\n<td>Copper, Silver, Iodine, Iron, Carbon</td></tr><tr>\r\n<td>2</td>\r\n<td>Potassium, Ethanol, Lithium, Silicon, Bromine</td></tr><tr>\r\n<td>3</td>\r\n<td>Table salt, Sugar, Orange juice, Tomato juice, Milk</td></tr><tr>\r\n<td>4</td>\r\n<td>Spaceacillin, Saline-glucose solution, Epinephrine, <a href=\"/wiki/Guide_to_chemistry#Multiver\" title=\"Guide to chemistry\">Multiver</a></td></tr><tr>\r\n<td>5</td>\r\n<td>Oil, Synaptizine, Mannitol, Space drugs, Cryptobiolin</td></tr><tr>\r\n<td>6</td>\r\n<td>Phenol, Inacusiate, Oculine, Antihol</td></tr><tr>\r\n<td>7</td>\r\n<td>Leporazine, Mindbreaker toxin, Higadrite</td></tr><tr>\r\n<td>8</td>\r\n<td>Pax, Happiness, Ephedrine</td></tr><tr>\r\n<td>9</td>\r\n<td>Lipolicide, Salicylic acid</td></tr><tr>\r\n<td>10</td>\r\n<td>Haloperidol, Aranesp, Diphenhydramine</td></tr><tr>\r\n<td>11 or more</td>\r\n<td>Modafinil, Anacea</td></tr></tbody></table>\r\n<ul><li><b>Required Organ:</b> Another hidden stat.

The exceptions to this rule are the decaying uranium gel (only if you're rolling for level 7 symptoms) and virus food chemicals, since they are much, much cheaper to make than more exact chemicals of their tiers. It should be noted that one bar of uranium can be mixed with other chemicals to get you 20u of decaying uranium gel, but only 4u of unstable uranium gel.</li></ul>\r\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"The_Black_Death\">The Black Death</span></h3>\r\n<p>Being a traitor virologist opens you up to a whole variety of cruel and interesting ways to create chaos on the station. Here's some tips to allow you to spread your worst creations.\r\n</p>\r\n<ul><li>Here is where statistics become important: you need Resistance to avoid the cure being salt, you want Transmissibility so your virus can spread, Stage Speed so it acts before the victim is cured, and Stealth to avoid it being noticed too quickly. The Severity of your virus determines how quickly and aggressively natural recovery will affect your virus after somebody is infected. You won't have them all on a single virus, so choose the direction you want to go with.\r\n<ul><li>A high stealth will allow the virus to incubate before the victim notices and make it less likely for medical staff to notice on scans or HUDs.</li>\r\n<li>A high resistance will make the cure so rare that it won't realistically be available to everyone. Beware of <a href=\"#How_to_create_a_vaccine\">vaccines</a>, though.</li>\r\n<li>A high stage speed will cause your virus to progress at extreme speed, giving targets less warning before acting.</li>\r\n<li>A high transmissibility will allow you disease to spread itself without your help; it will also make it so you need more clothing to protect from infection.</li></ul></li>\r\n<li>While it might seem a good idea to put many harmful symptoms on a virus, its stats will be lowered to the point it won't act before it is cured. Stick to one or two harmful symptoms, and add neutral ones to buff its statistics.</li>\r\n<li>Because severity is a function of the number of symptoms, whether or not they are active, and the overall stats of your virus, making viruses with fewer than the total number of symptoms and selectively neutering some of them may give you more effective combinations. The only way to check severity in-game is with the use of a medical HUD, and the combinations are too many to discuss in depth - experiment with varieties of 'weaker' viruses to find more potent combinations.</li>\r\n<li>All symptoms give out messages to the infected before they reach the stage where they activate. People will be aware of what is hindering/killing them. Consider investing in stealth to prevent this if your virus uses symptoms that benefit from stealth.</li>\r\n<li>Going around outside of virology with a biosuit will alert people that you don't trust your own virus: you might want to infect yourself with a harmless resistant virus, so people can see that you're infected as well, while you'll be immune.</li>\r\n<li>Remember that live and walking infected spread more than corpses. Consider making a disease that hinders many instead of one that kills a few. Although dead people can't work on a cure.</li>\r\n<li>Monkeys or other humanlikes can carry viruses and often receive less immediate suspicion than somebody in a blood-soaked biosuit - especially if the virus doesn't have immediate obvious symptoms.</li>\r\n<li>Blood spills and infected glassware (beakers, cups) can spread the virus if it has the Fluid transmission vector or better. You don't need to be around for these things to work.</li>\r\n<li>A syringe gun filled with infected blood is a good way to spread viruses if you can't trick the crew.</li>\r\n<li>Sabotaging the Pandemic is usually a good idea, as it can create a <a href=\"#How_to_create_a_vaccine\">vaccine</a> for a cured virus which is cheap and easy to distribute, even if the virus is extremely resistant.</li>\r\n<li>Destroying all of your viruses (and the ones in your chem fridge) other than the one that you are going to use before you release your doomvirus by dumping the containers holding them out onto an adjacent tile and then using a spray bottle of space cleaner on the resulting pile of blood can be a good idea, since clever CMOs/players can infect themselves with one of your prototype viruses to overwrite your main doomvirus with a less harmful virus/version of it (provided that the less harmful virus's transmission stat is higher than your doomvirus's resistance stat).</li>\r\n<li>Sabotaging the holodeck computer is also a good idea because its Emergency Medical simulation also contains a Pandemic.</li>\r\n<li>Sabotaging chemistry can stop them from making most of the chems that can cure viruses.</li>\r\n<li>Adding your virus to food the chef has cooked is a good way to spread your virus.</li>\r\n<li>Curing one virus may be easy. Curing many viruses at the same time - especially when they all require different vaccines and cures - may be hard.</li>\r\n<li>Naming your virus is a great way to take credit for your accomplishments... or to frame your local virologist. Viruses without names will be 'unknown' until named in a Pandemic or otherwise associated with a named virus.</li></ul>\r\n</div>"
