You must know how to counter any and all threats that are thrown at you, preferably with minimal force needed on your part. Remember, however, that not only is the station's peace at risk, but your very life is on the line; fail and you will die! Here is NT's staple guide on suggested courses of action against expected threats.\r\n</p>\r\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Tiders\">Tiders</span></h3>\r\n<p>Single tiders can be punished with a timed brig sentence like any other criminal. If they come back looking for trouble, again and again, start asking about a perma sentence. A \"three-strikes\" rule is a generally accepted standard.\r\n</p><p>Criminals screaming that security is rogue or murderous (when they're actually not) should be threatened with a stint in perma. \r\n</p><p>In cases of a full-on invasion by <a href=\"/wiki/Assistant\" title=\"Assistant\">Assistants</a> (a greytide), lethal force (within reason) is justified. Don't be afraid to crack a few skulls if it means keeping the <a href=\"/wiki/Armory\" title=\"Armory\">Armory</a> secure. \r\n</p><p>A persistent greytider should be <a href=\"/wiki/Adminhelp\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Adminhelp\">admin-helped</a> once all possible <a href=\"/wiki/IC\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"IC\">IC</a> solutions have been evaluated.

If someone is suspected of being a Traitor, get several Officers to search the person in question and possibly search their department for hidden items. Interviews with witnesses and victims can help in proving the guilt of a possible Traitor. You should generally offer the chance for a perp to surrender before engaging unless they are actively hostile. In the case of overt traitors, however, you will need to respond with a proportionate level of force.\r\n</p>\r\n<ul><li><b>Improvised Weapons</b>: Order the AI to lock down the area, assess if civilians are at risk and use ranged stun weapons to subdue the perp. They are a low-risk threat to you unless they are somehow able to stun you.</li></ul>\r\n<ul><li><b>Stolen Station Weapons</b>: Assume they are carrying at minimum a ranged firearm capable of stunning. Ask the AI to locate and lock down the area. Multiple Officers should attempt to simultaneously attack the perp. The use of Flashbangs will prove effective if the perp is well entrenched.</li></ul>\r\n<ul><li><b>Syndicate Weapons</b>: The suspect should be presumed to be armed and dangerous, and AI should report and track the perp's location. Do not approach without backup. Consider asking the Warden/Head of Security to issue Riot Shields and Energy Guns. If the suspect is wielding Dual Energy Swords, ranged energy weapons (including disablers) will prove ineffective. Flashbangs, stun batons, shotguns or the <a href=\"/wiki/Detective\" title=\"Detective\">Detective's</a> revolver will be suitable (just be sure the detective doesn't kill the suspect).</li></ul>\r\n<ul><li><b>Spray Bottle</b>: A unique \"device\". Small amounts of water can slip people for long periods of time, making them drop their weapons. If the suspect is reported to possess a Spray Bottle or Fire Extinguisher, do not approach without walking. If the suspect is using ranged weapons in conjunction, be wary and avoid getting into a bad situation. Consider getting Cargo to order Galoshes or ambush the traitor.</li></ul>\r\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Changelings\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Changeling.gif\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"Changeling.gif\" src=\"/wiki/images/8/8c/Changeling.gif\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"32\" height=\"31\" data-file-width=\"32\" data-file-height=\"31\" /></a> Changelings</span></h3>\r\n<p><a href=\"/wiki/Changeling\" title=\"Changeling\">Changelings</a> are alien entities that have infiltrated the station. They can easily change their appearance at a moment's notice. If there are confirmed sightings of Changelings, be wary. Sometimes you will encounter one with bio-organic armour, a shield that stops ranged disablers in their tracks, and an incredibly deadly arm blade. Don't underestimate them under any circumstances!\r\nDue to their abilities, it is possible for a Changeling to kill a fellow Sec Officer and impersonate him. However, you should note that they will lack a <a href=\"/wiki/Security_items#Mindshield_Implant\" title=\"Security items\">Mindshield Implant</a> unless they had themselves implanted. Be wary of Sec Officers without Implants, as they should be arrested or kept under close watch. While you are free to terminate a confirmed Changeling, you must be 100% certain that the suspect is a Changeling before executing. If you cannot prove they are a Changeling, ask the Warden/HoS to give them a Chem/Tracking implant to watch their future activities. So if Joe Innocent walks out of the brig with a Chem Implant displaying a red or blue dot above their head on the SecHUD, and later on you see Alex Antag with the same dot, you will know that they are probably Changeling.\r\n</p><p>The same standard tactics in subduing a Traitor apply to subduing a Changeling, however, do be wary that some Changelings can get up instantly after being stunned and sometimes melt their handcuffs. If they do, you may need to switch to lethal.\r\n</p>\r\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Nuclear_Operatives\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Generic_nukesyndie.png\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"Generic nukesyndie.png\" src=\"/wiki/images/6/60/Generic_nukesyndie.png\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"32\" height=\"32\" data-file-width=\"32\" data-file-height=\"32\" /></a> Nuclear Operatives</span></h3>\r\n<p>A five-man team of operatives are tasked with assaulting your station, stealing the Nuclear Authentication Disk, and destroying the station via a thermonuclear device. You must make every effort to stop them. During a nuclear threat, you are recommended to ignore most other crimes on the station. You need the crew to fight alongside you. \r\n</p><p>The <a href=\"/wiki/Nuke_ops\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Nuke ops\">Nuke Ops</a> are equipped with a deadly array of weapons and devices that are better than yours in every regard. Guns can knock you down and kill you with a few rounds. Assault mechs and cyborgs that can tear a hole into wherever they goddamn please. Hardsuits that offer protection from the hazards of space, ballistic and energy weapons. This is a team of five-ish hardass sons of bitches who won't go down without a fight, and they'll probably explode if you manage to take 'em down. Proceed with caution.\r\n</p><p>Upon the confirmation of Nuclear Operatives, get the Warden/HoS to open the armoury and distribute weapons. At the same time, confirm the location of the nuke disk, which should hopefully be on the Captain, and ensure that it stays as far away from the ops as possible. From this point, you should prioritize protecting the disk at all costs. Consider asking for a bulletproof vest and helmet, since nuke ops often use bullets, and bulletproof vests block 80% of bullet damage to the chest and head, which can be very helpful. If the AI is still alive at this point, make sure it calls the shuttle.\r\n</p><p>When fighting nuke ops, use numbers and cover to your advantage. Avoid exposing yourself and concentrate on one Operative at a time. If you can attack an isolated operative, go for it. If you own an op, attempt to strip as much of its gear as you can before the op triggers its explosive implant. Remember that as long as the disk is with you, you only need to defend, so don't give up that advantage until you have to.  \r\n</p><p>If you encounter a Mech, fall back and regroup. The only way to take down a mech is with concentrated firepower or an ion weapon (like the rifle in the <a href=\"/wiki/Armory\" title=\"Armory\">armoury</a> or HoS personal laser. \r\n</p><p>The Syndicate Cyborg, like regular cyborgs, is immune to stun weaponry. Your best bet for countering one of these is to flash it with your flash or a flashbang and then go to town on it with your stun baton or another melee weapon. \r\n</p><p><b>Securing the Disk is your number one priority.</b> Keep the disk bearer alive at all costs and protect it. If you have a choice between killing an operative and saving the disk, <b>save the disk</b>! If you lose the disk, quickly secure EVA gear and scour the exterior of the station to find the Ops. If you are lucky you can catch them trying to arm the nuke. A <a href=\"/wiki/Pinpointer\" title=\"Pinpointer\">pinpointer</a> helps greatly in this situation.\r\n</p>\r\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Wizard\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Generic_wizard.png\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"Generic wizard.png\" src=\"/wiki/images/c/c1/Generic_wizard.png\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"32\" height=\"32\" data-file-width=\"32\" data-file-height=\"32\" /></a> Wizard</span></h3>\r\n<p>An extremely powerful entity, if a <a href=\"/wiki/Wizard\" title=\"Wizard\">Wizard</a> is confirmed, rally the Security and arm up with the best weapons you can get. The best way to terminate a Wizard is to stick together and focus fire on them. Shotguns are ideal weapons. Wear them down with a constant shotgun or laser-fire. Do not go at them alone or you will die. If you can safely stun them, either open fire with lasers or remove their clothing to shut down most of their spells. Do not enter into melee range unless you can confirm that they cannot use Disintegrate or Magic Missiles.\r\n</p><p>If by some miracle you are able to subdue a Wizard, immediately secure them with cuffs, a straightjacket and a muzzle. This will usually shut them down completely and render them harmless. At this point, your greatest threat is the crew trying to kill the helpless Wizard. If you still wish to preserve their life, move to the Brig and push back people trying to kill them. Generally, at this point, the living Captain/HoS/Warden/Clown will either perform an execution or a trial for the Wizard.\r\n</p><p>Remember, even if the Wizard is named \"Friend the Friendly\", repeatedly says \"I'm a friendly Wizard\", and carries around a staff of healing, you are still allowed to kill it.\r\n</p>\r\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Revolutionaries\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Rev.png\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"Rev.png\" src=\"/wiki/images/2/23/Rev.png\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"32\" height=\"32\" data-file-width=\"32\" data-file-height=\"32\" /></a> Revolutionaries</span></h3>\r\n<p>Sometimes, a few crew members will have enough and rebel against the command staff and the security forces. Your job is to stop them at all costs and protect the command staff. <a href=\"/wiki/Revolution\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Revolution\">Revolutionaries</a> are as deadly as a traitor with improvised weapons, however, their greatest strength is their numbers. Disablers, energy guns and stun batons are useless against a swarm of 10 to 20 people clambering over the stunned and twitching bodies of fellow revs to get at your throat.\r\n</p><p>When you subdue a Revolutionary, you should mindshield implant them as fast as possible. This will remove their revolutionary status and prevent them from being converted again. If you cannot get access to a mindshield implant, simply targeting their head (make sure to remove any armoured helmet) and smacking them with your stun baton using <span class=\"tooltip\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Rightclick.png\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"Rightclick.png\" src=\"/wiki/images/thumb/a/a3/Rightclick.png/24px-Rightclick.png\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"24\" height=\"42\" srcset=\"/wiki/images/thumb/a/a3/Rightclick.png/36px-Rightclick.png 1.5x, /wiki/images/thumb/a/a3/Rightclick.png/48px-Rightclick.png 2x\" data-file-width=\"180\" data-file-height=\"312\" /></a><span class=\"tooltiptext\">Ordinary right-click.

However, even if successful, they will still be vulnerable to re-conversion. Another note: although you can no longer beat the revolutionary fervour out of someone once they have left this mortal coil, a mindshield implant <b>will</b> still work on dead revolutionaries. \r\n</p><p>If you mindshield implant someone and you get a message saying they \"seem to resist the implant\", <b>they are a head revolutionary!</b> You will need to exile them off the station z level or, more commonly, kill them if you want to defeat the revolution. \r\n</p><p>Work with your fellow security, the heads of staff, and other mindshielded crew to suppress the revolution. Oftentimes, revolutions are decided by which side can secure key departments/resources first; don't be afraid to mindshield implant crew in key departments even if you do not know they are a revolutionary, since it will prevent them from being converted later. Once you have a sufficiently large supply of mindshields, implanting random crew in the hallways is also justifiable. \r\n</p><p>Generally speaking, the most important departments initially are cargo and medbay. Cargo will be a vital battleground fought over, as it acts both as a critical source of mindshield implants for security and a source of weapons for the Revolutionaries. Medbay oftentimes becomes an early revolutionary hub, and a strong revolutionary medbay can make it very difficult to get security/command healed and revived. Science is the next most important department, not only for its ability to produce extremely dangerous mechs, bombs, mutations, golems and other items but also because of the possibility of an AI subversion. <b>If the revolutionaries manage to subvert the AI, counter-subverting it should be your top priority.</b> A subverted AI will shock and bolt all of the Brig doors, liberally grant all access to revolutionaries, cancel all of your mindshield orders, and generally make your life hell. \r\n</p><p>Engineering, while still dangerous, is less so than the other departments. Service and non-departmental crew (i.e. <a href=\"/wiki/Assistant\" title=\"Assistant\">Assistants</a>) are the lowest priority out of all.\r\n</p>\r\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Cultists\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Cult.png\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"Cult.png\" src=\"/wiki/images/0/0f/Cult.png\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"32\" height=\"32\" data-file-width=\"32\" data-file-height=\"32\" /></a> Cultists</span></h3>\r\n<p>Similar to Revolutionaries in a few respects, their goal is to sacrifice a specific crewmember and then summon Nar'Sie. \r\n</p><p>Fighting <a href=\"/wiki/Cult\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Cult\">Cultists</a> requires all hands on deck. You must be vigilant in fighting Cultists. Anyone outside of security and the Captain can be a Cultist. Work together to lock down the station, declare martial law (red alert), perform random searches for cult items and crack down on departments. Use force as necessary if people try to swarm you or follow you around.\r\n</p><p>When you capture a Cultist, your options are limited. Unlike Revs, mindshield implants do not revert their Cult-status, and only force the cult to sacrifice non-cultists and turn them into constructs instead of converting them. As such, you have few options. \r\n</p>\r\n<ul><li><b>Deconversion</b>: You should be aiming to deconvert all captured cultists, however at times this may not be viable (Usually during a shortage of Holy Water). See <a href=\"/wiki/Cult#How_to_Deconvert_a_Cultist_with_Holy_Water\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Cult\">How to Deconvert a Cultist with Holy Water</a>. A cultist can't be summoned by other cultists if cuffed and either grabbed or buckled.</li></ul>\r\n<ul><li><b>Permabrigging</b>: Don't bother. Cultists can create a new ritual dagger from nothing, and can just teleport out. can be used as a temporary solution while preparing to deconvert them, and secure the cultist with a straightjacket.</li></ul>\r\n<ul><li><b>Forced Borging</b>: Borgs can both be stunned and converted into constructs by cultists, so this isn't really worth the effort.</li></ul>\r\n<ul><li><b>Execution</b>: A controversial approach both in-game and out-game. This removes the Cultist permanently and removes the threat. It is quick and easy without any unneeded effort on your part. However if the AI and borgs witness or find evidence of this, the AI can be obligated to shut you down to prevent further human harm. You are free to kill confirmed cultists, especially when pentagram halos have appeared over their heads. But deconversion is the preferred solution.</li></ul>\r\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Security_Tactics\">Security Tactics</span></h2>\r\n<p>Being a Security member is all about teamwork, everything gets much easier and more effective once you work as a team.\r\n</p><p>There will be several tactics you can utilize as an Officer, or enforce in your department as HoS. (Try not to boss around while HoS is around)\r\n</p>\r\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Buddy_System\">Buddy System</span></h3>\r\n<p>The Buddy System involves every Officer having a buddy who follows them at all times, as such those 2 Officers work as a pair. Usually, 2 Officers assigned to the same department are paired together.\r\n</p><p>Working in a pair makes it much easier for Officers to engage threats, one officer can report the crime to the Security channel while the other can start immediate engagement. This also lowers casualty rates, attacking two officers at once is harder than attacking one.\r\n</p><p>You can also use this to train Deputies on how Security works, just make sure the Deputy is not traitorous or else his buddy Officer may suddenly disappear.\r\n</p>\r\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Task_Force\">Task Force</span></h3>\r\n<p>Working as a Task Force (more commonly known as \"Conga Line\") can be extremely helpful if you're dealing with a large amount of threats or a single extremely powerful one.

Only don't block the entrance with them.\r\n</p><p>At the shuttle you should keep the order, this can be rather challenging as shuttles most of the time resemble tin cans filled with extremely annoyed and angry fish. Help heads evict trespassers at the cockpit, and arrest anyone breaking down the order.\r\n</p><p>Prisoners in the Brig should only be released at the Warden's discretion. Prisoners from the Prison Wing should be moved to the Security Escape Pod or to the Escape Shuttle's brig where they will be held until the shuttle docks at <a href=\"/wiki/CentCom\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"CentCom\">CentCom</a>. \r\n</p>\r\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Key_Points\">Key Points</span></h2>\r\n<ul><li>Ask first, stun second, unless there's substantial evidence that the perpetrator has nothing to lose.</li>\r\n<li>Being unnecessarily harsh is generally frowned upon, even if it's in Space Law.</li>\r\n<li>It is highly encouraged to only arrest Heads of Staff with approval from HoS or Captain (unless they are clearly dangerous).</li>\r\n<li>Only the Captain, HoS or Warden can authorize a permanent sentence.</li>\r\n<li>Your job isn't to be a tyrant or your suspects will be praying to the Gods (read: Admins) for ultimate justice.
