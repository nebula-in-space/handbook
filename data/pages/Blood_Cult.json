Geometer of Blood, Nar'Sie, has sent a number of her followers to Space Station 13. As a cultist, you have an abundance of cult magics at your disposal, something for all situations. You must work with your brethren to summon an avatar of your eldritch goddess!\r\n</p><p>At the beginning of a Cult round, several cultists will arrive on the station. When you spawn, you'll find a ritual dagger and 10 runed metal in your bag. The dagger is essential for drawing runes, while the runed metal is used to make valuable structures; additional runes metal can be created by using the Twisted Construction ability on any ordinary plasteel.\r\n</p><p>The Cult has two major objectives. The first is to use an Offer rune to sacrifice a certain target to Nar'Sie. The target is shown to all cultists, and is often a high ranking member of the crew or a Security officer. Once the target has been sacrificed, Nar'Sie can be summoned in one of three predetermined locations on the station, using 9 cultists and/or constructs and after a 45-second rune drawing process. If Nar'sie is summoned, the Cult wins!\r\n</p>\r\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Cultist_Quick_Guide\">Cultist Quick Guide</span></h2>\r\n<p>Have you never played as a Cultist before, and find yourself subverted or starting off? Here's a quick primer on the most important aspects:\r\n</p>\r\n<ul><li><b>Communing:</b> The very first thing to do is find somewhere where you can be alone and talk to your fellow cultists using your Commune ability. Communing broadcasts messages to all other cultists, but <u>any nearby crew can see and hear you whispering, potentially revealing your cult.</u> Talk to your allies, find out where everybody else works and has access to, formulate a plan, and ask senior cultists for advice if needed.</li>\r\n<li><b>Blood Magic:</b> By clicking the Blood Magic icon, you can prepare up to one spell from a variety of blood magicks. Preparing a spell takes a few seconds and leaves a blood splatter on the floor, so do it somewhere where nobody's looking. Once you have a spell prepared, click its icon to 'put it in your hand', and click on a target with it to use it. Starting off, the most important spells are generally Stun and Teleport.</li>\r\n<li><b>Cult Bases:</b> By using your Ritual Dagger, you can create runes at your feet. To create a starting cult base, find somewhere secluded and safe to start placing runes. The most important rune is a Teleport rune, which lets any cultist warp to it using the Teleport blood magic spell or by clicking on a different rune. Commune once you have a Teleport rune up in a safe place, so others can join you. Make sure no non-cultists find your runes!</li>\r\n<li><b>Runes:</b> Afterwards, place an Empower rune; standing on it lets you prepare four blood magic spells simultaneously. Finally, an Offer rune lets you convert others to your cause by dragging them onto it and clicking on it with an empty hand. Offering requires two cultists and/or constructs to be standing by the rune, so make sure you have a friend with you to help. There are other runes, but Teleport, Empower and Offer are the most important.</li>\r\n<li><b>Conversions:</b> Once you have a base, you can begin Offering. While standing on the Empower rune, prepare a Stun, a Shadow Shackles, and two other spells; remember you can prepare multiple Stuns at once. Find a crewmember, Stun them, drag them somewhere secluded, Shackle them, remove their headset if the base is too far away, then drag them back to it, put them on the Offer rune, and use it with a friend or stand on and activate a Spirit rune next to it. Of course, if you have the means to abduct people without blood magic, feel free to use mundane methods. If they don't have a mindshield implant, they'll become a cultist; if they're implanted, like Security or the Heads, they'll explode violently and leave behind a soulstone. Either outcome is good for you.</li>\r\n<li><b>Structures:</b> By using the Runed Metal cultist begin with (get more by using the Twisted Construction blood magic on plasteel), you can build one of four constructions: pylons, altars, archives and forges. Each cultist starts with enough metal to build 3 of the 4 options, so once you have a main base going, make sure someone's built at least one of each except for pylons; pylons only heal cultists, but the other three let you build useful items, weapons and tools. Don't build items unless you need them; once any item is built, that structure goes on a 4 minute cooldown. If you have the metal, building multiples of each structures isn't a bad idea.</li>\r\n<li><b>Constructs:</b> When you sacrifice an implanted crewmember on an Offer rune, they'll leave behind a soulstone shard. Create a construct shell at an altar, and you can put the soulstone inside it to transform the soul within into a construct. Constructs come in three types: utility Artificers, tanky Juggernauts and sneaky assassin Wraiths. The first one you create should almost always be an Artificer, as they can create more soulstones and shells. If a soulstone is empty, using it on a corpse will attempt to put the corpse's soul into the shard, and you can release the soul as a much less useful Shade by clicking it in your hand.</li>\r\n<li><b>Going Loud:</b> Unless your cultists are (un)godly talented and lucky, you'll eventually be caught out. Either someone will slip up, somebody will find your base, or your cult will grow so powerful that it becomes impossible to hide (red eyes, then a dark halo). Once you know the jig is up, start playing more aggressively; place extra Teleport runes and mini-bases around the station in case your main hideout gets raided, make more power moves to convert or kill crewmembers, and find some way to kill or subvert the AI if it hasn't been done.</li>\r\n<li><b>Summoning Nar'Sie:</b> The first step to actually summoning your dark god is to Offer her desired target, randomly picked at the start of the round and shown in the top-right of your screen. Use teamwork and co-operation to take them down, drag them to your base, and sacrifice them. Once they've been offered, their icon is replaced with a list of three locations where Nar'Sie can be summoned. Head there, fortify the location, ideally have your Cult Master use Final Reckoning to bring the entire cult to the summoning spot, and begin drawing the final rune. Drawing the Nar'Sie rune requires a 3x3 area, takes 45 seconds, surrounds the drawer in forcefields, and tells the entire station where it's happening, so make your final stand against whatever's left of the crew! If you can hold out long enough to finish the rune, have 9 cultists and/or constructs stand on it (use the 'rest' button to lie down and make more room), click on it with an empty hand, and Nar'Sie will be summoned, giving your cult the win!</li></ul>\r\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"The_Cult_Master_and_You\">The Cult Master and You <a href=\"/wiki/File:Cultist.png\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"Cultist.png\" src=\"/wiki/images/thumb/b/bd/Cultist.png/32px-Cultist.png\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"32\" height=\"29\" srcset=\"/wiki/images/b/bd/Cultist.png 1.5x\" data-file-width=\"35\" data-file-height=\"32\" /></a></span></h2>\r\n<p>The Cult Master is the leader of your cult, the main driving force behind your goal to summon Nar'Sie. The Cult Master has access to a wide variety of abilities to assist the cult in achieving its goals. Make sure to protect and serve him/her at all costs, as they are the key to the cult success!\r\n</p><p><b>IMPORTANT:</b> The Cult Master is the only one capable of using the Final Reckoning, a single-use, extremely powerful ability suited for ending the round. It's highly recommended that a Cult Master not be selected until the cult is established; in fact, many cults choose not to pick a leader until they're ready to summon Nar'Sie.\r\n</p><p><br />\r\n</p>\r\n<h3><span id=\"So,_how_does_one_become_the_Master?\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"So.2C_how_does_one_become_the_Master.3F\">So, how does one become the Master?</span></h3>\r\n<p>When the round first starts, an additional button along with your Commune verb will be available. The \"Assert Leadership\" button will allow you to apply for the Cult Master status. Once a member of the cult asserts their leadership, an announcement will be made to all cultists. After a few seconds, a vote will be called where the cult can vote whether or not they want that person as the Cult Master. If the vote passes, the player will gain the Cult Master's abilities. If you are not the Master, make sure to follow his/her orders, as they are now your superior!\r\n</p><p><br />\r\n</p>\r\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Being_The_Master_of_Wrist_Cutting\">Being The Master of Wrist Cutting</span></h3>\r\n<p>So, you asserted your leadership and won the vote of the cult. Congratulations on your promotion to Cult Master! I hope you know what you are doing. If you have experience playing as a department head this shouldn't be too different, minus the killing and summoning elder gods part. \r\n</p><p>To summon Nar'Sie, you are going to need to keep organized and grow your numbers as much as possible while remaining hidden. As the Cult Master, your Commune power is enhanced, making all of your messages large and bolded just like when you use a megaphone. This will assist greatly in organizing the cult, as the other cultists will be able to easily see your messages among the common radio rabble.\r\n</p><p><br />\r\nHere is a quick reference guide on what you should be doing as the Cult Master:\r\n</p>\r\n<ol><li>Determine a hidden, easily defendable location for your cultists to congregate. They will need a place to create runes and structures to assist the cult.</li>\r\n<li>Beat back and silence any potential <a href=\"/wiki/Security\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Security\">intruders</a> to your hideout.</li>\r\n<li>Stay back and relay information and orders with use of the Spirit Realm rune, and let your <a href=\"/wiki/Assistant\" title=\"Assistant\">goons</a> handle the dirty work. Make sure to have a Medbot, Pylon or some other source of healing nearby so you don't drain your life completely.</li>\r\n<li>Staying at the base helps you reach the two-cultist requirement you need to convert someone. When a fellow cultist manages to snag and send back an unconverted crewmember, you will be there to bring them into the cult.</li>\r\n<li>While around your base, it is recommended to create items from the Altars and Forges to have a fresh supply of equipment ready when everyone needs it at once. Nobody likes waiting around the Forge because someone made a single set of armor and ran off.</li>\r\n<li>Lead your brethren into battle when the time comes to face the crew head on!</li>\r\n<li>Use your unique powers to move things around, target foes for your fellow cultists and use the Final Reckoning when you are ready to summon Nar'Sie herself!</li></ol>\r\n<p><br />\r\n</p><p>In the end, you call the shots. Your cult doesn't have to be run like this; experiment and find what works and doesn't! Even if you lose (odds are you will lose... a lot), you'll be better prepared for the next time the Cult of Nar'Sie needs a leader.\r\n</p><p><br />\r\n</p>\r\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Cult_Master_Powers\">Cult Master Powers</span></h3>\r\n<p>As the Cult Master, you have access to a handful of powerful and versatile occult powers to assist you and the rest of the cult. These powers can be accessed from the HUD on the top left. The powers are as follows:\r\n</p>\r\n<table border=\"2\" cellspacing=\"1\" cellpadding=\"2\" class=\"wikitable\">\r\n<tbody><tr>\r\n<th style=\"background-color:brown\" width=\"64px\"></th>\r\n<th style=\"background-color:brown\" width=\"140px\">Name</th>\r\n<th style=\"background-color:brown\" width=\"830px\">Description</th>\r\n<th style=\"background-color:brown\" width=\"73px\">Cooldown</th></tr><tr>\r\n<td><a href=\"/wiki/File:Final_Reckoning.png\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"Final Reckoning.png\" src=\"/wiki/images/5/59/Final_Reckoning.png\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"64\" height=\"64\" data-file-width=\"32\" data-file-height=\"32\" /></a></td>\r\n<th>Final Reckoning</th>\r\n<td>A single-use spell that brings the entire cult to the master's location.

Using an Empowering Rune circumvents this issue and allow you to acquire up to 4 spells. You can use an Empowering Rune to remove these spells as well to free up room for others if need be.\r\n</p><p>A good tip is to make sure to try and have a stun spell and a teleport spell with you to escape risky situations.

There are ways that you as a normal crewmember can either fight or stay safe from their occult influence. Here are some suggested courses of action if you are a non-cultist and care for your well being:\r\n</p>\r\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Chaplain\"><a href=\"/wiki/Chaplain\" title=\"Chaplain\">Chaplain</a><a href=\"/wiki/File:Generic_chaplain.png\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"Generic chaplain.png\" src=\"/wiki/images/6/6c/Generic_chaplain.png\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"32\" height=\"32\" data-file-width=\"32\" data-file-height=\"32\" /></a></span></h3>\r\n<p>The Chaplain is immune to conversion and is able to turn normal water into <b>Holy Water</b>, which can deconvert cultist back into normal people. With a <a href=\"/wiki/Chaplain#Null_Rod\" title=\"Chaplain\">Null rod</a> in inventory, the Chaplain is also immune to cult magic. The bible is able to make hidden runes visible. You are not immune to being sacrificed. \r\n</p><p><b>When cult activity is confirmed:</b> Make sure you have your <a href=\"/wiki/Chaplain#Null_Rod\" title=\"Chaplain\">Null rod weapon</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Chaplain#Holy_Book\" title=\"Chaplain\">Holy Book</a> with you. Grab a water tank, bless it with your book so it turns into holy water, and drag the tank to the brig. The brig is now your home. You are a primary target for the cult, and will sometimes also be their sacrificial objective. \r\n</p><p><b>(Optional) when brig has holy water secured:</b> Grab a <a href=\"/wiki/Atmospherics_items#Fire_Extinguisher\" title=\"Atmospherics items\">Fire Extinguisher</a> from a wall. Empty it and fill it with holy water. You can use it to start blessing tiles, which blocks Blood Beams and prevents <a href=\"/wiki/Construct#Wraith\" title=\"Construct\">Wraiths</a> from jaunting over them. \r\n</p><p><b>(Optional) if the AI has not been moved:</b> Have the <a href=\"/wiki/AI\" title=\"AI\">AI</a> let you into its chamber, so you can bless it. Many cults will kill the <a href=\"/wiki/AI\" title=\"AI\">AI</a> early, by constructing a <a href=\"/wiki/Construct#Wraith\" title=\"Construct\">Wraith</a>. The wraith can easily jaunt in, appear right in front of the <a href=\"/wiki/AI\" title=\"AI\">AI</a> and kill it. You can prevent this by blessing most tiles in the AI's chamber. \r\n</p><p><b>When you are safe in the brig:</b> You can cooperate with security and stick close to them. Hopefully, they will treat you with respect in return and give you some gear. If the time comes, you may then choose to be the vanguard in the final battle against the cult.\r\n</p><p><br />\r\n</p>\r\n<h4><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Purified_Soulstones_and_Constructs\">Purified Soulstones and Constructs</span></h4>\r\n<p>Anyone (not only chaplain) can purify a soulstone shard with a bible, and then put it into a found construct shell to create <a href=\"/wiki/Construct#Purified_Constructs\" title=\"Construct\">purified constructs</a>, which will help the crew.\r\n</p>\r\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Security\"><a href=\"/wiki/Security\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Security\">Security</a><a href=\"/wiki/File:Generic_hos.png\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"Generic hos.png\" src=\"/wiki/images/4/40/Generic_hos.png\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"32\" height=\"32\" data-file-width=\"32\" data-file-height=\"32\" /></a></span></h3>\r\n<p>Even the best-prepared and robust members of the Cult will have trouble defending themselves against the united power of security, especially if the Chaplain helps them. Your job is to deconvert (or kill if necessary) cultists, find and crack down on cult bases, and destroy <a href=\"/wiki/Construct\" title=\"Construct\">constructs</a>. Remember: the safety of the station and its staff are on the line, and it's probably your fault if you fail.\r\n</p>\r\n<h4><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"How_to_Deconvert_a_Cultist_with_Holy_Water\">How to Deconvert a Cultist with Holy Water</span></h4>\r\n<p><b>Step 1: Find a suspected cultist.</b> If less than 20% of the crew are converted they will look like normal crew, so you will have to look for people who are behaving suspiciously or are caught standing near runes. Small brute injuries on one arm or isolated blood spills in someone's workplace could also be signs. If you know that more than 20% of the crew are (or at some point were) converted to the cult, you should ask suspected crewmembers to take off their eyewear. When examining a cultist a red text will then say <span style=\"color:red;\"><b>\"his/her eyes are glowing an unnatural red!\"</b></span>. If more than 40% of the crew is (or was) cult, you will also see pentagram halos above their heads. \r\n</p><p><b>Step 2: Arrest the suspected cultist.</b> Disable/stun and cuff, like any other criminal. As long as cuffed cultists are either held or buckle-cuffed to a chair, they can not be teleported away by their fellow cultists. Take them to the interrogation room. \r\n</p><p><b>Step 3: Check the suspect's bag for a ritual dagger </b>(or other cult items). The cult might still be too small to have glowy eyes. Lock it away so it can't be used to stop deconversion, in case a prisoner resists out of the cuffs. Take off any cult gear as well, as they might hurt the prisoner after deconversion if worn. \r\nRemember to check EVERYWHERE. Some cultists may be hiding their gear in more discreet locations on their person. A good one to watch out for is if they have hidden their dagger in their boots if they are wearing Jackboots or Workboots.\r\n</p><p><b>Step 4: Force feed the confirmed cultist at least 25 units of Holy Water</b>. Use <b>30 units</b> to be safe. Each sip contains 5 units. It takes exactly 60 chemical ticks (about 2 minutes or less) to deconvert a cultist. After 25 ticks (about 50 seconds or less) the cultist will have a 20% chance per tick to spout random cult sentences which, when it happens, also has a 10% chance to cause 12 seconds of unconsciousness. Stunbaton or flash the prisoners every now and then to make sure they don't resist out of the cuffs. The holy water will instantly clear out blood rites and blood spells. \r\n</p><p><b>Step 5: <a href=\"/wiki/Security_items#Mindshield_Implant\" title=\"Security items\">Mindshield Implant</a> the cultist.</b> Mindshield implants will not deconvert cultists, but they will prevent them from being converted/reconverted. They can still be sacrificed and turned into constructs though. <a href=\"/wiki/Security\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Security\">Security</a> and the <a href=\"/wiki/Captain\" title=\"Captain\">Captain</a> are implanted by default. \r\n<br /><br />\r\n</p><p>Like with <a href=\"/wiki/Revolution\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Revolution\">revs</a>, you will see a big purple message when a nearby person is deconverted: <b>\"-Name- looks like he/she just reverted to his/her old faith!\"</b><br />\r\n<br />\r\nDeconverted cultists do not keep their memories from their time in the cult.\r\n</p>\r\n<h4><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"If_Shit_Hits_the_Fan\">If Shit Hits the Fan</span></h4>\r\n<p>If you start seeing pentagram halos you might not have time to arrest and deconvert anymore. Team up, gear up with your weapons of choice, and start blasting people with halos. If the situation feels under control again then go back to deconverting. <br />\r\n</p><p>Here are some tips and tricks for security:\r\n</p>\r\n<ul><li>Mirror shields can instantly shatter, stunning their users, if hit by a shot that does 30 damage or more. Many types of shotgun ammo, such as slugs, should do the trick.</li>\r\n<li>Zealot's Blindfolds protect against flashes, but not against bangs. Use <a href=\"/wiki/Security_items#Flashbang\" title=\"Security items\">flashbangs</a>.</li>\r\n<li>Consider arming deconverted and implanted former cultists. They should be your confirmed allies.</li>\r\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/Construct\" title=\"Construct\">Constructs</a> cannot be stunned and are usually never on your side in a cult round. Kill them with lethal weapons without hesitation.</li>\r\n<li>Mindshields can be applied to members of the Cult even when they are not converted; they only protect against hostile mind conversion. Don't just go randomly implanting people until you know who is really on your side.\r\n<ul><li>Extremely crafty cultists can disguise as a recently murdered Security Officer and steal an implant for themselves to look life officers. Don't expect this to happen often, but the possibility is there.</li></ul></li></ul>\r\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Medbay\"><a href=\"/wiki/Medbay\" title=\"Medbay\">Medbay</a><a href=\"/wiki/File:MedicalDoctor.png\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"MedicalDoctor.png\" src=\"/wiki/images/4/45/MedicalDoctor.png\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"32\" height=\"32\" data-file-width=\"32\" data-file-height=\"32\" /></a></span></h3>\r\n<p>If you work in the Medbay it's not your job to directly fight the cult, but you may still do so if you wish. Whatever you do, be careful about attacking people if you are not sure who is cultist or not. The same goes for every other department as well. <br />\r\n</p><p>Here are some general tips and tricks for Medbay workers: \r\n</p><p><b><a href=\"/wiki/Medical_Doctor\" title=\"Medical Doctor\">Medical Doctors</a>:</b> Examine people before healing them, to check for glowy eyes or cult gear. If you don't see anything obvious, then try to do your job as normal. <br />If you have holy water you can be extra helpful by building a <a href=\"/wiki/Guide_to_chemistry#Smoke_Machine\" title=\"Guide to chemistry\">smoke machine</a>. Print the board from the medical techfab or ask the AI to let you into the <a href=\"/wiki/Tech_Storage\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Tech Storage\">tech storage</a> so you can grab it. Print stock parts and cable coil from an <a href=\"/wiki/Autolathe\" title=\"Autolathe\">autolathe</a>. Fill it with holy water and turn it on. Cultists who breathe the holy water will have their prepared spells deleted, so they can no longer stun you. The holy water smoke will also bless tiles if 10u or more touches them. \r\n</p><p><b><a href=\"/wiki/Chemist\" title=\"Chemist\">Chemists</a>:</b> You can create non-lethal syringes with <a href=\"/wiki/Guide_to_chemistry#Chloral_Hydrate\" title=\"Guide to chemistry\">Chloral Hydrate</a> or other chemicals, to use in a syringe gun. Then if you accidentally shoot a non-cultist it won't be a big deal. If you manage to put a confirmed cultist to sleep, then feel free to cuff them with <a href=\"/wiki/Makeshift_weapons#Cablecuffs\" title=\"Makeshift weapons\">cablecuffs</a> and bring them to the brig for deconversion. You can also make <a href=\"/wiki/Guide_to_chemistry#Ephedrine\" title=\"Guide to chemistry\">combat drugs</a> and hand them to security. \r\n</p><p><b><a href=\"/wiki/Geneticist\" title=\"Geneticist\">Geneticists</a>:</b> You can try to find powers such as thermal vision or hulk, and then make injectors to give to <a href=\"/wiki/Security\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Security\">security</a> (or use yourself). \r\n</p><p><br />\r\nAlso, try to keep your distance from people acting suspiciously. Medbay usually has some secluded areas, and cultists can easily stun and kidnap you in melee range. Don't try to fight them unless you know what you're doing.\r\n</p><p><br />\r\n</p>\r\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Cargo\"><a href=\"/wiki/Cargo\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Cargo\">Cargo</a><a href=\"/wiki/File:Generic_cargo.png\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"Generic cargo.png\" src=\"/wiki/images/4/4f/Generic_cargo.png\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"32\" height=\"32\" data-file-width=\"32\" data-file-height=\"32\" /></a></span></h3>\r\n<p><b>Order Religious Supplies crates.</b> If the Chaplain is nowhere to be seen and security don't have any holy water, order this as fast as possible. The crate contains holy water. \r\n</p><p><b>Order <a href=\"/wiki/Security_items#Mindshield_Implant\" title=\"Security items\">Mindshield Implants</a>.</b> If people really don't want to be converted to the cult, they can request to be implanted after cult presence is confirmed. If security is properly deconverting crew, they might run out of implants unless cargo ordered more. \r\n</p><p><b>Order guns.</b> If you have a way to open the crates, then guns could help give you or <a href=\"/wiki/Security\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Security\">security</a> the upper hand. Remember, be careful about who you shoot if you don't know who is a cultist. Prefer using non-lethals if holy water is available. \r\n</p><p><br />\r\n</p>\r\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Science\"><a href=\"/wiki/Science\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Science\">Science</a><a href=\"/wiki/File:Scientist_generic.png\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"Scientist generic.png\" src=\"/wiki/images/9/9e/Scientist_generic.png\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"32\" height=\"32\" data-file-width=\"32\" data-file-height=\"32\" /></a></span></h3>\r\n<p><b><a href=\"/wiki/Guide_to_Ordnance\" title=\"Guide to Ordnance\">Ordnance</a></b>: While bombs should be the crew's last resort, they are the strongest weapon you can use to stop a Nar'Sie summoning.
