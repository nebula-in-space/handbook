It has a few things of note. First you need to learn some terms:\r\n</p>\r\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Unique_Enzymes\">Unique Enzymes</span></h3>\r\n<ul><li>Unique Enzymes (UE) = <b>Your name</b>. Even if you mutate the UE it will have no effect on the name. What you can do however, is to transfer UE from one person to another, copying their name.</li></ul>\r\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Unique_Identifiers\">Unique Identifiers</span></h3>\r\n<ul><li>Unique Identifiers (UI) = <b>Your cosmetic details</b> - eye color, skin color, hair style, hair color and gender. <br /></li></ul>\r\n<p>In the DNA scanner access console there is a tab named \"Enzymes\". This tab can be used to copy UE and UI between people.\r\n</p>\r\n<ul><li>Click \"Save\" to save a person's UE + UI to the console. You can not save mutations this way (anymore).</li>\r\n<li>Click \"Transfer\" to copy the genes of the buffer to whoever is inside the scanner. You can choose between <b>Enzymes</b> (UE), <b>Identity</b> (UI) and <b>Full Makeup</b> (UE+UI).</li>\r\n<li>Click \"Transfer (Delayed)\" to copy the genes of the buffer to the next person who steps into the scanner and closes it (such as yourself). This option is only available if the scanner is empty.</li>\r\n<li>Click \"Print\" to print a DNA injector containing the genes of the saved buffer. Injecting this into a person will transfer the UE, UI or UE+UI to that person. Unlike mutation <a href=\"#Activators_and_Mutators\">injectors</a> however, these DNA injectors are not permanent, and will only last for a short while after injected.</li></ul>\r\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Structural_Enzymes\">Structural Enzymes</span></h3>\r\n<ul><li>Structural Enzymes (SE) / Genetic Sequence = <b>Your mutations</b>. They contain data relevant to your genetic structure. This governs your race and mutations. The term \"Structural Enzymes\" is no longer used by the DNA scanner access console since it was replaced with \"Genetic Sequence\" (which is the same thing), but the term may still show up elsewhere.</li></ul>\r\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Genetic_Sequencer\">Genetic Sequencer</span></h3>\r\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:202px;\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Genetic_Sequencer.png\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/wiki/images/thumb/b/b0/Genetic_Sequencer.png/200px-Genetic_Sequencer.png\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"200\" height=\"263\" class=\"thumbimage\" srcset=\"/wiki/images/thumb/b/b0/Genetic_Sequencer.png/300px-Genetic_Sequencer.png 1.5x, /wiki/images/thumb/b/b0/Genetic_Sequencer.png/400px-Genetic_Sequencer.png 2x\" data-file-width=\"539\" data-file-height=\"710\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Genetic_Sequencer.png\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>This is what the Sequencer tab may look like with a human in the scanner.</div></div></div>\r\n<p>In the DNA scanner access console there is a tab named \"Sequencer\". Here you will alter genes to find mutations. There are <b>four</b> types of blocks: A, T, C and G. Each pair of letters in the boxes are connected. <b>A goes with T, and G goes with C.</b> Order does not matter. Each pair has a correct combination of \"AT, TG, CG or GC\" that needs to be filled. If you see a an unmodified pair be X-T it means the right combination of that pair is A-T. When all 16 pairs have the right blocks, the mutation will activate and you will be able to store it. Monkeys can only have the <i>monkified</i> mutation unless <a href=\"#Humanizing_a_Monkey\">humanized</a>. Once you have found the name of a mutation, that mutation will be permanently identified in all DNA scanner access consoles. <br />\r\n</p><p>You might want to disable the monkey mutation by replacing one of the healthy pairs with another letter. How to do all this will be detailed in <a href=\"#Guide_to_finding_and_using_mutations\">the guide below</a>. <br />\r\n</p>\r\n<h4><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Genetic_Sequence_Scanner\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Gene_scanner.gif\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"Gene scanner.gif\" src=\"/wiki/images/a/a5/Gene_scanner.gif\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"32\" height=\"32\" data-file-width=\"32\" data-file-height=\"32\" /></a> Genetic Sequence Scanner</span></h4>\r\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:202px;\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Gene_scanner_results.png\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/wiki/images/thumb/8/8d/Gene_scanner_results.png/200px-Gene_scanner_results.png\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"200\" height=\"89\" class=\"thumbimage\" srcset=\"/wiki/images/thumb/8/8d/Gene_scanner_results.png/300px-Gene_scanner_results.png 1.5x, /wiki/images/8/8d/Gene_scanner_results.png 2x\" data-file-width=\"344\" data-file-height=\"153\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Gene_scanner_results.png\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>What it looks like after clicking someone with the \"Genetic Sequence Scanner\" item, and then using the Genetic Sequence Scanner in hand and selecting \"Mutation 39\".

You cannot just randomly enter A-T, since it's predetermined what it's supposed to be. Knowing all this, you could whip out the genetic sequence scanner <a href=\"/wiki/File:Gene_scanner.gif\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"Gene scanner.gif\" src=\"/wiki/images/a/a5/Gene_scanner.gif\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"32\" height=\"32\" data-file-width=\"32\" data-file-height=\"32\" /></a> from your pocket. If you're looking for the correct pairs of mutation 39, scan people until you find a person with mutation 39. Then use the scanner in your hand for a menu to pop up. In the menu, select \"mutation 39\".

Dissolve a pill by pouring a tiny amount of water into a beaker (by using the beaker on a sink once), then drop a pill of <a href=\"/wiki/Guide_to_chemistry#Mutadone\" title=\"Guide to chemistry\">mutadone</a> into it and take a sip. It should instantly clear all your mutations.</li>\r\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/Guide_to_chemistry#Mutadone\" title=\"Guide to chemistry\">Mutadone</a> will also clear the <i>monkified</i> mutation from monkeys, instantly turning them human. Use a dropper set to 1u to squirt the dissolved <a href=\"/wiki/Guide_to_chemistry#Mutadone\" title=\"Guide to chemistry\">mutadone</a> into the eyes of monkeys to mass humanize them without needing any machinery.

Advanced injectors will let you save multiple mutations in a single injector. The amount of mutations in a single \"save\" is limited to 50 <a href=\"#Genetic_Instability\">instability</a> or 10 mutations. Unlike activators or ordinary mutators, these can be named anything you want. To create an advanced injector, do the following:\r\n</p>\r\n<ol><li>Go to either the \"Storage - Adv. Injectors\" tab.

All humans can withstand up to <b>99 genetic instability</b> before they start to bubble and melt. 100 instability would be too much. What happens when you suffer from a genetic breakdown is random and unpredictable, and draws from one of two lists of effects, ranging from 'Mostly Harmless' to 'Dead and Unrevivable'. Negative mutations generally don't give you instability, but powers do. As a rule of thumb, the stronger the power, the more instability it gives. Choose your powers wisely.\r\n</p>\r\n<h4><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Chromosome_21\">Chromosome 21</span></h4>\r\n<p>Every time you successfully use an ACTIVATOR on another person, the activator becomes filled with genetic data. Recycle/use it on your DNA console for a 60% chance to gain a random chromosome. The chromosome gets stored in the \"Storage - Chromosomes\" tab. Clicking on a chromosome gives you information about it. You can also eject it into its physical form. Physical chromosomes can only be used by inserting them into a DNA console. <br /><br />\r\n</p><p>Each active mutation in a person has a single chromosome slot. You can only add chromosomes to people who are inside the connected DNA scanner. Do so by opening the <i>Sequencer</i> tab. Then click an activated mutation, or <a href=\"#Manifesting_Mutations\">find one</a> if none is active yet. You should see the line <i>Select a chromosome</i> followed by a list of chromosomes that mutation would be compatible with. Select a chromosome in the dropdown menu and you have now filled that mutation's chromosome slot. To delete the chromosome from a mutation you need to deactivate and reactivate the mutation by changing any letter and then back. <br />\r\n</p><p>After you have added a chromosome to a mutation, you can <i>store</i> it to the <i>Storage - mutations</i> tab as normal (by clicking <i>Save to console</i> in the <i>Sequencer</i> tab). Mutations from mutators/activators printed from this stored entry will then contain that chromosome. The stored entry will retain its applied chromosome if saved to a Genetics data disk and transferred to a different DNA Scanner console.\r\n</p><p>These are the currently available chromosomes you can get (the chance for a chromosome to be of a specific type is listed next to that type in parenthesis):\r\n</p>\r\n<ul><li><b>Synchronizer</b> (5/16): Gives the mind more control over the mutation, reducing some downsides by 50%.</li>\r\n<li><b>Stabilizer</b> (1/16): The rarest chromosome.

To complement this function, cloners can do Body-Only scans, which can only be used to create empty clones but not real clones, and bypass the sentience restrictions that ordinary scans have. These body-only entries can be deleted without requiring access.\r\n</p>\r\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Cloning_Errors\">Cloning Errors</span></h3>\r\n<table class=\"wikitable\">\r\n\r\n<tbody><tr>\r\n<th>Error message</th>\r\n<th>Cause</th>\r\n<th>Solution</th></tr><tr>\r\n<td>Unable to locate valid genetic data.</td>\r\n<td>Whatever you put inside the scanner doesn't have valid (humanoid) DNA.</td>\r\n<td>Stop putting bees in the scanner.</td></tr><tr>\r\n<td>Subject's brain is not responding to scanning stimuli.</td>\r\n<td>The person inside has suicided or signed an infernal contract.

I wanted to use that for a very long time.\r\n</p><p>So, you learned how to do your job successfully, and how to be a credit to the station. You learned how to manipulate genes. Now you want to learn what the hell to do when the syndicate is the one writing your checks! Well, fret not! I will give you some pointers. But these are mostly tips - traitorous objectives differ wildly, and change your actions way too much for me to write a real guide on it.\r\n</p>\r\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Revolutionary\"><a href=\"/wiki/Revolutionary\" title=\"Revolutionary\">Revolutionary</a></span></h3>\r\n<p>If you managed to kill a head of staff, copy their identity with a DNA scanner and apply it to yourself. Impersonating a head of staff during a revolution is useful since they are usually exempt from implanting.\r\n</p>\r\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Traitor\"><a href=\"/wiki/Traitor\" title=\"Traitor\">Traitor</a></span></h3>\r\n<p>Depends on your objective. If it's a hard one, like stealing the AI... well, you're fucked. Keep working on those powers! As soon as you have Hulk + TK, go for it as you wish. No tips here.\r\n</p><p>If your objective is a simple one, though, like stealing the hand tele, there are more approaches to this. As the above tip, you can just break the walls with TK Hulk, but that is rather crass. There's a more roundabout, but classier way to tackle this. Take a monkey from the pen, transform it in a human. Take its UI+UEs, make an injector, stuff it in your pocket with a label like \"Clean Backup - Alexa White\".<br />Now get your own UI+UEs and name it \"Clean Backup - Original\" or something. Avoid using your name. Now, go hide somewhere close to the item's location, stick yourself with the monkey injector, spawn doorjack, stick ID and PDA in your backpack. For added stealth, get a different outfit. doorjack your way to the captain's room, get his hand tele, RUN RUN RUN. The AI might see you, so it would also be good if you spawned an agent card so you can't be tracked. If anyone sees you, they're not going to see your actual name, only the humanized monkey's name. Hide, stick yourself with your own stuff, change clothes, walk away smoothly.\r\n</p><p>If you have to kill someone, same stuff from rev.\r\n</p><p>Also, never forget identity theft. Since you can take someone's complete identity, including looks, you can have some fun with that.\r\n</p>\r\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Changeling\"><a href=\"/wiki/Changeling\" title=\"Changeling\">Changeling</a></span></h3>\r\n<p>You can DNA sting humanized monkeys to quickly gather stored genomes. Similarly, once people start coming for mutations, you will have plenty of DNA to collect.\r\n</p>\r\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Returning_to_Monke\">Returning to Monke</span></h3>\r\n<p>If you're looking for combat or stealth bonuses, you may use <i>Monkified</i> to get the monkeys', as well as several useful mutations (e.g., <i>Telekinesis</i>, <i>Shock Touch</i>, <i>Chameleon</i>, <i>Gigantism</i> and <i>Dwarfism</i>). \r\nMonkeys have the ability to steal items from people's hands, ventcrawl, and several other benefits. The transformation is unexpensive and available extremely early in the round (unlike the <a href=\"/wiki/Scientist\" title=\"Scientist\">Xenobiologist's</a> slime transformation).\r\n</p><p><span id=\"Guide_to_gorilla\"></span>\r\nAlternatively, there are <a href=\"/wiki/Critters#Gorilla\" title=\"Critters\">gorillas</a>. Since the <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/pull/62265\">radiation modernization changes (Oct, 2021)</a>, you have a nearly-exclusive access to gorillas. You may transform monkeys into gorillas, including yourself, other crewmembers or antagonists.\r\n</p><p>Given their status as a <i>simplemob</i>, gorillas are immune to wounds and most chemicals—essentially the <i>Hulk'</i>s weaknesses. They are additionally immune to stuns and shoves (like Hulks), viruses, and mutations. Unlike Hulks, they are unable to destroy reinforced walls.\r\n</p>\r\n<ul><li>Note that gorillas are thus also immune to the benefits of those, and to surgeries. Healing is going to be more complicated than for hulks, and someone may Lazarus their carcasses to assist against the other gorillas.</li></ul>\r\n<p>The gorilla AI is extremely hostile, keeping aggro until their target is dead, and have a tendency to delimb corpses people that are unconscious (incl. hard crit).\r\n</p><p>To transform a monkey into a gorilla, you have two options:\r\n</p>\r\n<ul><li><i>Genetic bombing:</i> once above 2500 genetic damage, monkeys have a 25% chance per second to transform.</li>\r\n<li><i>Mind-Magnification Helmets:</i> when removing MM helmets, the sentient monkey has a slight chance (2.5%) to turn into an equally sentient gorilla.</li></ul>\r\n<p>Additionally, the <a href=\"/wiki/Traitor\" title=\"Traitor\">Traitor</a> geneticist's uplink offers <a href=\"/wiki/Syndicate_Items#Box_of_Gorilla_Cubes\" title=\"Syndicate Items\">Gorilla Cubes</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Syndicate_Items#Magillitis_Serum_Autoinjector\" title=\"Syndicate Items\">an autoinjector</a> turning them into a gorilla.\r\n</p>\r\n</div>"
