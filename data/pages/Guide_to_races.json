Although NT treats all of its employees with some <s>meager, borderline negligent</s> degree of respect, lingering speciesism means that only humans are typically accepted for command roles. Additionally, the default <a href=\"/wiki/AI\" title=\"AI\">AI</a> lawset <i>only</i> forces the AI to obey and protect humans, although many AIs will offer assistance to other races as long as doing so doesn't offend their human masters. Should a conflict arise between a human and another race, expect the AI to take the human's side.\r\n</p><p><b>Gameplay</b>\r\nBehave like the dominant species you are. Beat skulls in with a toolbox and remind everyone that you are essentially a bald ape. Flaunt your superiority over lesser races, only to be overthrown by disgruntled reptiles/insects/lightbulbs/skeletons/anime catgirls. Mutate into something more interesting, then regret it when the AI you verbally shit on electrocutes you.\r\n</p><p><b>Diet</b>\r\n</p>\r\n<ul><li>Likes: Fried food and junkfood, often combined into a heavenly form known as fast food.</li>\r\n<li>Dislikes: Raw food, gross food (mice, mold, ...), clothes.</li></ul>\r\n<p><b>Benefits</b>\r\n</p>\r\n<ul><li>The only race with AI Protection under the default Asimov lawset.</li>\r\n<li>Domination of <a href=\"/wiki/Command_Staff\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Command Staff\">Command Jobs</a>.</li>\r\n<li>Strength in numbers.</li></ul>\r\n<p><b>Drawbacks</b>\r\n</p>\r\n<ul><li>None at all.</li></ul>\r\n<p><b>Where to find them:</b>\r\n</p>\r\n<ul><li>Everywhere.</li></ul>\r\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Lizardpeople\"><span id=\"Lizardperson\"></span><a href=\"/wiki/Lizardperson\" title=\"Lizardperson\">Lizardpeople</a></span></h3>\r\n<p><a href=\"/wiki/File:Lizardpeople.png\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"Lizardpeople.png\" src=\"/wiki/images/c/c4/Lizardpeople.png\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"135\" height=\"87\" data-file-width=\"135\" data-file-height=\"87\" /></a>\r\n</p><p>Second class citizens in the eyes of many, the reptilian species commonly known as lizardpeople often take on more menial jobs aboard NT stations, earning anything from almost equal respect to obvious racism from their human co-workers. Although they're often derided as being rat eaters, lizardpeople have successfully lobbied for most NT stations to include cultural delicacies from their homeworld, and lizard culture and cuisine is on the rise. Many lizards have striking appearances including frills and horns, and they often adopt naming conventions that absolutely aren't just stolen from Skyrim Argonians.\r\n</p><p><b>Gameplay</b>\r\n</p><p>Name yourself Does-The-Gimmick. Set all your accessory slots and become an unrecognizable blob of pixels. <strike>Be locked out of important positions.</strike> Threaten the HoP with a lawsuit if he doesn't promote you to a Head position and get promptly lasered to death.

Although alarming in appearance and demanding of unique environmental equipment to function, the Colonids' ability to form sentient networks have led to plasmamen being accepted as an independent species by NanoTrasen, for reasons entirely unrelated to their ability to recycle employees that suffer tragic accidents into productive workers. Being such a recently established race, their culture is still in its infancy.\r\n</p><p><b>Gameplay</b>\r\n</p><p>Leverage your incredibly drastic racial traits to either combust to a light, oxygenated breeze, or thrive in inhospitable conditions.
