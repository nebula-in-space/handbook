<p>Brain Traumas are afflictions caused by unchecked brain damage, usually caused when a <a href="/wiki/Clown" title="Clown">poor, innocent crewmember</a> gets bashed in the head with a blunt object. They can severely debilitate players, or very rarely imbue them with supernatural powers <a href="/wiki/Beyond_the_impossible" class="mw-redirect" title="Beyond the impossible">if they're lucky</a>.
</p><p>If you are planning on working as a <a href="/wiki/Medical_Doctor" title="Medical Doctor">Medical Doctor</a> or the <a href="/wiki/Chief_Medical_Officer" title="Chief Medical Officer">Chief Medical Officer</a>, then you will need to know what traumas there are and how to deal with them.
</p><p>Traumas are visible to Health Analyzers, and will give a short indicator telling the user which trauma is affecting the patient.
</p><p>A player gaining a trauma will generally see a warning message unique to the trauma, so you usually will be fully aware when you get one.

<p>The big bad list of all the potential traumas any aspiring brains surgeons could come across during their career working for <a href="/wiki/NanoTrasen" class="mw-redirect" title="NanoTrasen">NanoTrasen</a>. Some are mild and may just take a swig of chemicals to get a person going, others are more serious and take prepped surgery. Some even are... <a href="/wiki/Wizard" title="Wizard">supernatural</a> in nature, and defy logic or reason. 
</p><p><br />
<b>Note:</b> You can only naturally gain one Mild Trauma and one Severe/Special Trauma at the same time from brain damage. However, other sources of traumas ignore this restriction.

</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Mild">Mild</span></h2>
<p>Mild traumas are relatively easy to get: they require a minimum of 20 brain damage. They can cause minor annoyance in several ways, like stuttering, hallucinations, phobias, or poor balance.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Brain_Trauma_Prefixes">Brain Trauma Prefixes</span></h2>
<p>You can identify the level of cure needed to fix a brain trauma by scanning the patient with a health analyzer. Different level traumas have different prefixes. These prefixes can easily be confused with the different trauma categories on this page, but they are separate systems, which normally overlap since <a href="#Severe">severe</a> traumas usually have the severe prefix, and so on. 
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Basic_Traumas_Without_Prefix">Basic Traumas Without Prefix</span></h3>
<p>These traumas have no prefix on health analyzer. <a href="/wiki/Guide_to_chemistry#Neurine" title="Guide to chemistry">Neurine</a> will cure <b>basic</b> brain traumas.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Severe_Prefix">Severe Prefix</span></h3>
<p>You can identify severe brain traumas by the prefix "severe" on health analyzer. <a href="/wiki/Surgery#Brain_Surgery" title="Surgery">Brain Surgery</a> will cure <b>severe</b> traumas. 
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Deep-rooted_Prefix">Deep-rooted Prefix</span></h3>
<p>You can identify deep-rooted brain traumas by the prefix "deep-rooted" on health analyzer. <a href="/wiki/Surgery#Lobotomy" title="Surgery">Lobotomy</a> will cure <b>deep-rooted</b> brain traumas.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Fracture-Derived_Prefix">Fracture-Derived Prefix</span></h3>
<p>You can identify fracture-derived brain traumas by the prefix "fracture-derived" on the health analyzer. These brain traumas are side effects of either a <a href="/wiki/Guide_to_Wounds#Severe:_Hairline_Fracture" title="Guide to Wounds">hairline fracture</a> or a <a href="/wiki/Guide_to_Wounds#Critical:_Compound_Fracture" title="Guide to Wounds">compound fracture</a> dealt to the head.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Permanent_Prefix">Permanent Prefix</span></h3>
<p>You can identify permanent brain traumas by the prefix "permanent" on health analyzer. <b>Permanent</b> brain traumas are either permanent or curable with magic, which is typically unavailable. Failing a lobotomy can cause these traumas.  If you get one of these then assume "this is life now".
